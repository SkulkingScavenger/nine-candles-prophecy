	The blight exists within all the forsaken. A spreading, cancerous rot that inexorably devours its victims from within. It was because of this blight that their ancestors were condemned to the Oubliette without hope of escape or rescue, that the corruption might be contained.

	The Blight can be delayed, but only the silver laudanum might be said to be a cure, and even that will not avail those who have been utterly consumed. 
	Those who find the blight manifested on their bodies are sent to wander far from their homes: even death will not prevent the blighted souls from wandering in the darkness, seeking to consume the luminosity of the living.
