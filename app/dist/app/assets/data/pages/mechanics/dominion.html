	Nine were the realms that mathranoath ruled, and nine are the realms that were swallowed by darkness.<br><br>
	Fallen kingdoms, sunken and lost,<br> their people scattered,<br> their lands befouled.<br>
	Yet though the light has abandoned them, the authority of their ancient guardians remains, and their wardens will never forsake them. Not though they must sacrifice all else, though they be damned, though they go mad...
	<br><br>
	The wardens are still bound by their oaths, even now. From these they derive both their duties and their power, both of which are bound up with an ancient order, an inviolable law written in fire. Each warden holds a dominion: that which it is bound to preserve, to nurture, and over which it is given authority. It may be a single tree or a wide forest, a vice or virtue, a family, a kingdom, or the sky itself... or any collection of such items<br>
	A warden may exercise his or her power only to the extent of their authority. Far from their own lands, against those over whom they have no claim, their magic cannot avail. Their ability to manifest, to communicate, to Be, is likewise bound up with this concept of Dominion.<br>
	The boundaries of a wardship are not exclusive and, increasingly, they are impermanent. Indeed, the hierarchy of wardens is somewhat feudal, with great lords subleasing aspects of their dominions to lesser. Interplay between rival claims can be complex. Authority can be gained or lost, particularly with regard to mortals, those shifting ones, ever changing and moving, and who if nothing else may voluntarily enfeoff themselves, by use of certain old rites and the invocation of the proper names.<br>
	<br><br>
	However, outside of the esoteric society that exists beyond the veil of dreams, the term “dominion” (where it is used at all) in most cases refers to the Nine, the primordial dominions of the archwardens, of which all other dominions are merely fiefs.<br>
	Sometimes these are referred to as the nine realms, or the nine kingdoms. All these terms are subtly different, but such subtlety is often lost as language decays. Strictly speaking, the nine dominions are those lands, peoples, beasts and concepts belonging respectively to each of the nine archwardens. The nine realms, worlds, or sometimes (with varying appropriateness) kingdoms refer to concepts that were originally synonymous to the dominion: the nine worlds or planes of which Mathranoath was sovereign. 
	<br><br>
	These days it is difficult to say with certainty where these begin or end. Perhaps it is most accurate to say that all of them were ended long ago: that what remains are mere carcasses, buried in darkness, their substance dispersed and dissolved, food for worms and rats. <br>
	The term is sometimes used in contrast to the primordial oubliette: the caverns, pits and tunnels that preceded the darkness and over which the wardens originally held no claim. Though the spread of the darkroot and the black winds have infiltrated these barren regions, there remain places hidden away, into which neither warden nor gremlin has ever set foot, where the shadows do not gnaw and the wandering dead may at last find repose.
	<br><br>
	But in general, the forsaken do not remember the old kingdoms, and the mysterious laws and prerogatives of warden society are grasped only as a vague superstition. One haunted ruin is much like another, and as the tunnels slowly shift and alter course, old maps and records become worthless. Thus, only witches and navigators use the old names, or remember them for that matter, as all that pertains to the old worlds have been long relegated to the realm of esoteric lore.
