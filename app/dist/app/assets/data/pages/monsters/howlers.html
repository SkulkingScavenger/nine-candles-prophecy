	Troglobyte descendants of the great wolves of Korhazar, blind and pale, with twice the savagery and cunning to compensate. Their mournful howls carry the bitterness and misery of the wandering dead whose bones they are wont to feast upon in their burrowing, piercing the souls of the living like knives of frozen sorrow.
