	The flesh offers an anchor to the vagrant soul. A name is an anchor to the world
	The secrets of Hekkath necromancy have slowly spread throughout the oubliette, and in New Tharas and the citadel of candles, shamblers are employed as bondsmen by local sorcerers and those who can afford to purchase their services.
