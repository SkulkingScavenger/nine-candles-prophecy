		<h3>Description</h3>
		<div class="subsection-body">
			Accursed and betrayed, the ghoulish creatures known as Gremlins lurk in the depths of the oubliette, silently prowling its dark paths and byways in search of prey. Though these skulking fiends were never meant to survive their exile, they have learned to thrive, to the sorrow of humans and wardens alike.
			<br><br>
			The Gremlins are diabolically crafty and as cold and ruthless as the oubliette itself. They are a constant menace to expeditions and have even been known to launch coordinated attacks on fortified settlements should the opportunity present itself. Those unfortunate enough to fall into their clutches may expect no pity from these vile scavengers, and their ravenous hunger for flesh admits of neither scrupulosity nor delicacy.
			<br><br>
			Though reviled for their abhorrent ways, gremlins are willing to trade for what they cannot take by cunning. Those desperate or callous enough to treat with them may find in them a vast knowledge of dark and secret things, for the gremlins are ancient and though rarely glimpsed or heard, they are always watching. They are also legendary for their smithcraft, for the gremlins are experts in the secrets of steel and fire.

		<h3>Appearance</h3>
		<div class="subsection-body">
			Creatures of rot, blight and bone, gremlins are appalling to behold and carry a faint carrion stench. They are typically of roughly humanoid form, though stooped and ratlike, able to scurry on all fours to clamber up walls and dive through narrow passages in the caves. <br>
			An amalgam of the worst features of rat, jackal and vulture, they are generally covered with black, rotting fur or feathers, with pale, rubbery tails and white, mask-like faces. Their claws are bony and viciously clawed
			<br><br>
			The features of individuals varies, sometimes dramatically, and those who manage to satiate their craving for light may undergo monstrous transformations, reverting closer to their primal state. <br>

		<h3>Society</h3>
		<div class="subsection-body">
			Gremlin society is loosely organized and dynamic, based on a tersely informal system of small detachments in orbit around a clan stronghold. Loners are a small minority, but form an important role as they travel from clan to clan, bearing news and messages. Those who can survive alone in the oubliette are viewed with great admiration
			Gremlin clans are generally attached to a well-hidden and/or fortified settlement, with a vaguely specified and mainly implicit range of territory. The highly individualist gremlins have little patience for bureaucracy, and clan governance is kept brutally simple: one or more chieftains orchestrate large raids, settle disputes and maintain security of the stronghold. A chieftain is appointed by a council of senior clan-members, typically upon the death of the old chieftain. Theoretically, the current chieftain could be impeached but gathering up the senior gremlins takes forever and malcontents historically have preferred murder over impeachment. 
			The majority of gremlin social structure is informal, based on ancient and unwritten customs. Skill and experience are valued above all else. Respect is understood as a kind of currency. Only the titles of Chieftain and Shaman are formally conferred
			Most gremlins remain attached to the clan to which they were born but acknowledge no obligation to do so and clan membership is viewed unemotionally, a matter of convenience rather than identity. Clans will also relocate, split or merge spontaneously as resources expand or contract. 
			For most gremlins, the stronghold is only a temporary resting place between raids: a place to stash loot, trade goods, share information, and make use of specialist services not available in the caves. These roam primarily in small, tightly-knit bands of hunters or raiders, which may stake out in a temporary hideout for weeks or months before returning to the main base. In practice, these bands make up the fundamental cells of gremlin society, and hold primary allegiance from their members. 
			Even the best craftsmen will prefer to work their trade in between raids, and all raiders have some skills, often acquiring great proficiency.
			Smiths are particularly revered in gremlin society, both for their role in warfare (scavenged human arms are a poor substitute, both for quality and for being ill-fit to gremlin anatomy) and for their closeness to fire.
			The heart of the clan is one or more incandescent cores, held in a shrine and guarded by the clan shaman, who harvests the incandescent ash and reads portents in its burning heart.

		<h3>Origins</h3>
		<div class="subsection-body">
			In the days of darkness following the death of Mathranoath, the wardens despaired, for in all their lands there was neither light nor hope. As they looked to the stars that burned in sunless skies, a dark desire awoke, and in desperation the wardens prepared the great sacrifice. 
			The archwardens tore at the the still living flesh of the entombed god, filling it with all their hunger and lust for light, and Krikirrik gave them black wings with which to ascend into the heavens. The corpse-born did as they were born to do, and hunted the children of Esha, devouring their incandescence with reckless greed. 
			Incandescent with stolen flame and swollen huge and fell upon the blood of angels, the corpse-born grew powerful beyond all control. The moths hid in the earth, and deprived of their prey the corpseborn turned greedy eyes upon the dominions. 
			Their purpose having been fulfilled, The wardens, partially for remorse at their sins against the moths and partly for fear that the corpseborn would grow beyond their control, assembled the corpseborn in bad faith and stripped them of their living flame. This fire they corrupted and fashioned into the sun below, and as for the corpse-born, they were to be reduced to lifeless ashen husks. 
			In this the wardens miscalculated, for the Corpseborn were not fully destroyed From darkness and hunger they were born, and though their light and wings had been stolen, that hunger remained, more terrible than before. nor were the wardens able to eliminate all the survivors, for they were at home in the darkness that the wardens feared, and took refuge in the deep old places beyond the dominions. And the gremlins never forgot or forgave the betrayal of the wardens, knowing well that they had been marked for extinction with the birth of the crimson sun. 
			Weakened, the survivors fled into the deep places of the oubliette, feeding upon death and blight and multiplying in darkness. And from those dark places they have come out ever since to devour the light that was stolen from them long ago.
