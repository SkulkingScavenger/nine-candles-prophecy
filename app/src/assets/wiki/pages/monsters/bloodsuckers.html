	Gangly skeletal humanoids with needle-like proboscis for siphoning blood. While ordinarily the bloodsuckers do not kill human prey, they are the secondary hosts of an insidious parasite, or perhaps symbiote. When the bloodsuckers feed upon humans, the parasites' cysts are transferred into the victims blood. Having once entered a human, the parasites' primary host, the cysts hatch and induce a hideous metamorphosis. Humans affected become mindless monsters who in turn serve the bloodsuckers as a source of labor and food, perpetuating the cycle.

	Because the Bloodsuckers only feed on blood rather than meat, they are seen as more benign than, say, skracks, and many humans willingly pay the bloodtithe required to live in the villages near Bloodlake Castle, where they enjoy the protection of their sanguinovorous overlords.
