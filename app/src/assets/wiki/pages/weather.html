	The Oubliette is cavernous and subterranean in many regards, but it is not without meteorological phenomenon<br>
	of a sort, anyway
	<h3>The Black Wind</h3>
	When the sour wind blows and the black rain falls, the wise take shelter and close their windows<br>
	For the wardens ride the wind, seeking whoever they might catch.<br>
	The hungry wind blows out of the great vents at the depths of the oubliette, from the exhaust of the crimson sun, stealing light and life to fuel the flames below. <br>
	<h3>Skyfall</h3>
	From time to time, huge carcasses fall through the mists into the oubliette, crashing with great violence and often piercing deep into the bowels of the caverns. Whenever these “falling stars” are detected, there is a great commotion among the gremlin clans for the corpse-stars are the source of many coveted resources. <br>
