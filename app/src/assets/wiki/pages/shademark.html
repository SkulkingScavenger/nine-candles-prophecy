	To succumb to the blight is the fate of the forsaken, which cannot be avoided. Yet there are a few who have given up their humanity and embraced the blight. Neither human nor shade, bearers of the shademark are rightfully mistrusted by all who hold luminosity in their hearts, for it is by preying upon the living that these creatures sustain themselves in the midst of corruption. And yet their unique powers make them useful enough that the living tolerate their presence as navigators and merchants
	<br><br>
	For only the shademarked can walk the boundaries between worlds without madness, to navigate the dark, ever-changing paths of the oubliette and read the burning sigils that mark the ways of the wardens.
