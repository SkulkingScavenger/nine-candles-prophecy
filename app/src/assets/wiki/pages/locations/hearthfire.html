	A small town tucked away in a cozy valley below the frigid caverns that lie north and upwards of Tharas. Out of the way of the bitter winds that howl through the caverns above, the chill of gently falling cave-snow is offset by the abundance of hot springs and the homely light of many fires. Some old magic protects the village from monsters and shades.

	Hearthfire is the last (safe, reputable) stop for those bound for the deep places, or for New Tharas. The Tharasi themselves rarely visit, and the relations between the two peoples are strained. Relations with the tharasi usually are, but doubly so in the case of Hearthfire, where the danger lies so near, and where the scars of past injuries still itch uncomfortably.
