	Seven great nails were forged by the seshek to contain the greatest of all the dead. In the course of the dark and terrible process by which gave birth at length to the crimson sun, one of those beams was removed from the divine carcass.<br>
	When in the passage of time, the archwardens created the first witchknights, they sought for a way to keep the flesh and spirit tightly bound, to draw both down together into deeper realms.<br>
	And they remembered the nail, for a chain may also be an anchor<br><br>
	It was bound to the crimson sun and shattered into eighty-one shards, one of which was driven into the heart of each of the knights. And these shards came to be called the Prisoners' thorns, though whether this refers to the present bearer or to the original prisoner is uncertain.<br><br>
	Now that the original witchknights have mostly been slain (or what amounts to it), the thorns have become an object of covetousness among the various archwardens, and even among their vassals.
