<div class="poem">
	You better beware of the old whisperghast<br>
	always winding and slinking and speaking of "Ghraast"<br>
	In tinsely whispers right into your ears<br>
	that prick at your brain just like tiny glass spears<br>
<br>
	It might not sound bad, but I promise it is<br>
	When it happens enough, you can feel your head fizz<br>
	It'll drive you up walls, it'll make you quite mad<br>
	You'll forget all the other thoughts you ever had<br>
<br>
	besides the word "ghraast" which ain't even a word<br>
	You might think that I'm joking, it sounds so absurd!<br>
	But you should really be careful, don't take me amiss<br>
	Even I wouldn't joke about something like this!<br>
