	Slow moving creatures like pony-sized harvestmen who creep silently through the tunnels on long spindly legs, coming out of the dark or dropping down from the ceiling to suck the blood from their victims. They prey mainly on caveleapers and juvenile bleakworms, but will attack anything warm that comes in reach of their long, thin, spearlike claws.
