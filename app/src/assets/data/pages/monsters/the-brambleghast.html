A hideous amalgamation of petrified wood and vines lurking in the depths of the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/labyrinth-of-roots">Labyrinth of Roots</a>. The Brambleghast appears to be a mass of reanimated plant matter, but within this thorny shell lurks a core of inky black, the dregs of hundreds of souls whose essence was sacrificed as fuel for the False Sun.
<br><br>
A particularly advanced dreg creature, The Brambleghast was created by the cursed tree <!-- <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/graybark-treelich"> -->Graybark Treelich<!-- </a> --> for the sole purpose of hunting down and murdering the wizard <!-- <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/greenbeard"> -->Greenbeard<!-- </a> -->.
<br><br>
Treelich forged the Brambleghast's husk from his own iron-strong bark and sap as it smouldered in the wound inflicted by Greenbeard. This he filled with dregs distilled from the human sacrifices offered to him by the men of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/ravensburg">Ravensburg</a>. Graybark fortified the wooden shell with powerful enchantments, granting the creature resistance to all manner of wizardry.
