<div class="poem">
	Oh skaga the cruel,<br> 
	what a magical beast!<br>
	she'll eat your whole family, right down to the least!<br>
	Her teeth are so sharp and her smile so wide...<br>
	It'll get even wider, when she's got you inside<br>
<br>
	She'll chew off your skin and she'll gnaw on your bones<br>
	And she'll laugh as you struggle and claw at the stones<br>
	She'll nip out your eyes and she'll bite off your toes<br>
	(She's really quite vicious, as far as <i>that</i> goes)<br>
<br>
	You might try to run (it's her favorite game!)<br>
	Or you might try to hide, though it ends much the same:<br>
	With your meat in her belly and your blood in a pool<br>
	There's just no escaping from Skaga the cruel!<br>

	Skaga currently lairs in the labyrinthine catacombs below Castle Nachtstein. She has a working relationship with <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/klaus-von-nachtstein">The Count</a>, enjoying the continuous supply of living prey provided by his endless wars against both his neighbors and his own rebellious peasants.<br> 
	In exchange, she guards the castle, watches his captains for signs of treachery, and convinces the peasantry that, really, there are much worse things than starvation and extortionate taxes.
