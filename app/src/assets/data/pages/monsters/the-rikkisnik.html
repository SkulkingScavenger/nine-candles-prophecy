	The Rikkisnik!<br>
	Son go and fetch me my smackin' stick!<br>
	Don't let the bugger get through the doors!<br>
	I don't give a smudge about your other chores!<br>
<br>
	If he gets in the house I might burn the place down<br>
	Oh god here it comes! Are you still in your gown?!<br>
	Oh never mind that, pass the stick he's right there!<br>
	Whatcha mean you can't find it? Grab a wrench! I don't care!<br>
<br>
	Oh no! it's too late! Grab your sister and scram!<br>
	There's only one hope; it can't see worth a damn<br>
	I'll try to distract it by clapping my hands<br>
	or snapping or twanging some old rubber bands!<br>
<br>
	Oh fudge its not working, its worse than I thought<br>
	It can't see OR hear, Oh I hate this a lot!<br>
	Can it smell? no I doubt it, it wouldn't make sense<br>
	I can't get it's attention with tic-tacs or mints<br>
<br>
	there it is, it's all over, guess I had a good life<br>
	All I've got left to try is this old butter knife<br>
	Oh he's fast and he's ugly! I can't seem to hit!<br>
	Oh no! get away! Oh he got me! I'm bit!<br>
