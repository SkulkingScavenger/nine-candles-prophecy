	A particularly dangerous variety of giant spider found deeper in the oubliette. Originating in the shadowy, twisted forests of zaramon, now long vanished, they have spread far and wide in all dark and lonesome places.

	Murkweaver Spiders spin enchanted webs from shadows and smoke, which devour light. They cannot be burned away by ordinary, nor can they be easily seen even in bright light, for their threads appear as little more than wisps of darkness. <br>
	To cut the threads safely, a knife of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/starbone">starbone</a> is recommended, but pure silver will do the trick as well. 
	<br><br>
	The murkweavers themselves are quite dangerous. Their poison causes permanent blindness, stealing the light of their victims' eyes. Moreover, their mere presence is sufficient to dim and even extinguish conventional torches and candles.<br>
	Those who plan to hunt murkweavers are advised to carry a supply of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/incandescent-ash">incandescent ash</a> for the spiders are powerless against True Light
