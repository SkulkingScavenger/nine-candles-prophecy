		Creatures of hungry flesh, who lust for the animating luminosity of mortals.<br> 
		They are related to shades, but their presence in the waking world is strong enough that they can be seen by ordinary humans, and their claws and teeth are terribly physical.
		<br><br>
		While shades represent a pervasive, almost environmental, hazard, ghouls present a tangible threat that must be met with sharpened steel. They often aggregate in catacombs, crypts, dungeons and battlefields, occassionally sallying forth to raid forsaken outposts or settlements.<br><br> They are particularly common in the dominions of Hekkath, Maelech and Korhazar, but may appear anywhere shades can be found
		<br><br>
		The precise appearance of a ghoul is somewhat mutable, and though more real than shades, they still partake somewhat of their dreamlike nature. In some cases a ghoul bears the husk of it's original body, but other times its appearance is more spectral.<br> 
		by far the most common manifestation is that of a cadaverous human, but ghouls who live long in dark places and are able to feed repeatedly upon living flesh will grow well beyond its original form and take on strange powers and properties unknown to their lesser kin. There is no telling what such "advanced ghouls" may eventually become
