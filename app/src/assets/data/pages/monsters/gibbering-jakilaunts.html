<div class="poem">
	On those terrible nights where the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/mechanics/weather#black-wind">rain</a> falls like ink<br>
	And you catch on the wind that particular stink<br>
	The gibbering Jakilaunt will crawl out of his hole<br>
	And set off with a mewling to curdle the soul<br>
<br>
	He'll mutter and shriek and make noises like "Quorm!"<br>
	So loud you can hear it even under the storm<br>
	Like a layer of undertone, subtle at first<br>
	Then he creeps past your window and, oh, its the worst!<br>
<br>
	But its all for the best, every now and again<br>
	If you're out far from home when the gibbers set in<br>
	It's a kind of alarm, giving out what's in store<br>
	A jakilaunt's call means you best get indoor!<br>
