<div class="poem">
	On those terrible nights where the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/mechanics/weather#black-wind">rain</a> falls like ink<br>
	And you catch on the wind that particular stink<br>
	The gibbering Jakilaunt will crawl out of his hole<br>
	And sets off with a mewling to curdle the soul<br>
