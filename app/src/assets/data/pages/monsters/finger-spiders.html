	A species of giant spider found in the lower oubliette, particularly near Hekkath and Ahoth. Their webs are woven from whispered lies, which can be made into a filmy, clingy silk the color of dust. 
	<br><br>
	They are extremely dangerous, both for their nearly invisible webs and for their blighting touch. Nevertheless, they are hunted for the dregs that accrete at the center of their fleshy carapace.
