In the oubliette, even death is not an escape. In times long past, this was a place of rest and tranquility, a final destination for the souls of the departed. Now it is a black and empty tomb, a prison of the mind and of the heart. And there is no rest here any longer. 
Those unfortunate souls who cannot be given a proper burial, their bodies left to decay in darkness, are doomed to wander as shades, where the darkness of the oubliette feeds slowly upon what little light remains to them. 
Shades are the ghosts of the oubliette. Not all are mad, but the older ones generally are, and even those who are not have often lost many of their memories.
