		Long ago, those humans infected with The Blight were condemned to the Oubliette, abandoned to die in the dark. Though many survived, huddling around their secret fires, their fate was a cruel one. For the memory of their ancient abandonment, they and their descendants are known to many as Those Who Were Forsaken. 
		<br><br>
		Many of the forsaken are descendants of the oubliette's original prisoners, swallowed up along with the doomed kingdoms to which they once belonged. However, there also those who have since found their way here by some unlucky magic. Only the latter remember the sun, and indeed, very few have the courage to leave their villages anymore, or the mettle to survive in the darkness.
		<br><br>
		The nature of the forsaken is of fire, however dim that fire may be at times. And as such luminosity is an object of much craving here, the forsaken find themselves a bitterly hunted people

		Forsaken communities lie scattered about the oubliette. In the early days, the forsaken were scattered and desperate, as are those who have become trapped since then. Wanderers, merchant caravans, and knightly orders may build camps or even fortified outposts.<br> 
		However, like sparks flung from a fire, these fragments of civilization are ephemeral things that begin to die even as they are born.
		<br><br>
		The vast bulk of the forsaken make their homes within more durable settlements, the isolated towns and villages where agriculture, mining and craftsmanship may be carried out on a self-sustaining scale. Illuminated by towering beacons, the so-called Great Candles, that act as surrogate suns and often fortified by high walls, the villages form restricted bubbles of safety in an ocean of darkness and peril. A semblance of stability and normality can be achieved here. In the light and warmth, the blight can be delayed and shades kept at bay, their corpses locked away within their vast crypts safely beyond the village walls.
		<br><br>
		However meager and monotonous village life may be, it is relatively safe and comfortable. Or at least, so it seems to the villagers. There is a certain strange anemia among the villagers, remarked by those who have spent time outside. They are silent and incurious. They cease to find the tedium oppressive, but a source of comfort, something to cling to all the tighter the more it is threatened. They resist nothing so long as it does not take them away from the routine, however painful or burdensome, as in the case of the wretched thralls of grayhaven whose cruel masters, to keep them obedient, take out their hearts and keep them in iron boxes.

		None of the villages of the oubliette are truly self-sufficient. So much has decayed, so much has been lost, even what has not must inevitably fade... At length it becomes necessary, in spite of everything, to go beyond the candlelight and seek places far and deep, that the candles may remain lit. 
		<br>
		Such expeditions, whether arranged by merchants, feudal lords, or village councils, generally take the form of caravans. Trains of wagons, crewed by a variety of laborers and defended by knights or mercenaries.
		<br><br>
		The organization and preparations are not unlike that of a long ocean voyage. At the head of the expedition are a captain, or caravan-master, responsible for the entirety of the operation, and a navigator. In rare occasions these are the same person.<br>
		In all but the most trivial (or desperate) cases, the navigator is a bearer of the Shademark. Maps of the ordinary variety are of little use in the shifting caverns of the oubliette unless they are very recent, and even then one cannot fully trust them. There are others who can pick their way safely through the oubliette, of course, but generally they are far worse even than the shademarked.

		So called for the pale, withered candles by which they navigate the caverns of the Oubliette, the designation is a miscellaneous one, synonymous with "wanderer" or "vagabond".
		<br><br>
		While most of the forsaken choose to remain all their lives fading away gently within sight of the Great Candles, there are a few who defy their alluring call and dare the unknown. And of course, there are those who find themselves cast out against their wishes. Some for crimes (although the fear of exile keeps most villagers meek and law-abiding), but most such exiles are those who have begun to succumb to the blight. Where laborers are scarce, these are merely consigned to the darklands, outside the outer walls and the brightlands nearest to the beacons, there to live out whatever days remain to them in darkness and (productive) squalor. 
		<br><br>
		But in kinder places, such exiles are granted a lantern (a lantern and nine pale candles in which to burn, is the traditional parting gift) and sent abroad with the slim hope of catching a Sorrow Worm or finding a fortune with which to purchase the coveted Silver Laudanum which alone may save them.
		<br><br>
		Whatever the reason, the candlebearers have no particular occupation. Adventurers, mercenaries, scholars or thieves... They are distrusted wherever they go

		Not all villagers are craven and soft. Against the hunger of the darkness, against gremlins, ghouls, monsters and demons stand a class of grim warriors, whose castles can be found scattered outwards from the walls of the villages. Whether bound to a hereditary fief or sworn to one of the holy orders, the knights of the oubliette are revered by the villagers under their protection, although such reverence may often be misplaced.
		<br><br>
		Not all knights are equal. In large cities like Grayhaven, a hierarchy of lords sits atop the ordinary knights who form a lesser class within the nobility, and the blight-touched wretchknights of the darklands may well be worse off materially than a skilled commoner within the walls. 
		<br><br>
		And of those who voluntarily forsake the safety of the villages for the death and madness of the oubliette, the overwhelming number are knights. Whether seeking glory on a worm-hunt, or in despair of prospects within their homelands, such knights-errant are a common sight

	</div>
	<div class="subsection-body">
		The accursed Shademarked Navigators are unwelcome within the walls of the villages for fear of their dark arts and because of their vampiric appetite for luminosity, of which they have none of their own.<br> 
		They may be known by their ink-black eyes and (less easily) by the cancerous shademarks upon their bodies, both of which weep blight as from an unhealed wound.
		<br><br>
		Nevertheless, their services are indispensable to the survival of the villages, and thus richly rewarded. For their own part, the shademarked have an insatiable craving for luminosity, which they can seldom slake in the depths. Most villages are not so desperate or depraved as to offer living sacrifices (or at least, they <i>usually</i> aren't...) but careful and experienced navigators can be subtle in their thievery and avoid feeding to an extent of causing obvious harm to their companions... a fact tactfully kept a secret among navigators. A bout of "caravan sickness" has become even an expected occurrence at the outset of an expedition
		<br><br>
		The Shademarked dwell always half in the waking world and half in that nightmare realm which can be glimpsed sometimes by those in the grip of blight-fever or near the brink of death. Their eyes perceive much that is hidden: the crimson fire that runs like blood through the veins of the earth, the teeming shades and spirits that haunt the corridors of the oubliette.
		<br><br>
		They do not fear the dark, nor the blight by which they have already been consumed. 
		<br>
		And they can never truly die: their bodies are merely husks. Their dark cores may wander bodiless for decades, rotting in the dream world like shades until they have preyed sufficiently upon luminous creatures to restore themselves. However with each iteration, memories are lost and their strength deteriorates. Too often, and the navigator may be reduced to a raving monstrosity of blight for all eternity
		<br><br>
		In addition, they are far more vulnerable to shades and other denizens of the otherworld. In fact is from their tendency to attract the attention of particularly vicious, light-hungry spirits that the term "shademark" originated

		The most dangerous and feared of all the forsaken are those practitioners of the dark arts whose descent into darkness and madness leads them into the hideous Red World beyond the veil of dreams, to the realms of the wardens, and back again: alive, but no longer human in any useful sense, their hearts eaten away by the insane gods to whom they have sworn their souls. 
		<br><br>
		Their knowledge of the abyss, of wards and of charms and of anchors is well beyond the amateur gropings of the Shademarked. The sigils scrawled in the blood of their victims speak with the authority of their burning patrons. 
		<br><br>
		Of course, the mighty wraiths and sorcerers who strike such fear and wonder into the hearts of the villagers are something of an anomaly, speaking statistically.<br> 
		There are many who foolishly or desperately offer up their hearts to the demons of the oubliette, hoping to earn at least a moment of power and glory before their debts come due, only to become disposable husks for ravenous and malevolents spirits, distilled into dregs once their usefulness has come to an end.<br> There are also many lesser "witches" who seek a dangerous middle ground: men and women learned in dark secrets who parley for favor with the sinister creatures of the night, hoping that in the end they may come away with something of themselves intact.
