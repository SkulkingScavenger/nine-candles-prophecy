		The forsaken were not the first of their kind to descend to the oubliette. This place has always been a home for restless spirits, lost souls seeking respite from the agony of life.
		<br><br>
		The Oubliette is no longer a place of repose, and yet all things heavy and indissoluble still seek the depths.
		<br><br>
		So many lost souls wander here, wailing sickly and rotting in the dark, Forgetting what it has meant to live

		So much of human existence is tied up with concerns of the flesh: to consume and grow and proliferate. Those who know nothing else but such desires must necessarily fade rapidly when they are gone. 
		<br>
		Indeed, they hardly need wait for what is termed death to grow dim and pale
		<br><br>
		And the slow decay of the animating fire, that insidious corruption which is known as blight, must continue until all chains are unbound.<br> 
		First the flesh, the face, the outermost husk<br>
		Then the name, an anchor to the world<br>
		Then the memory, a conception of what has been<br>
		Then the mind, the consciousness of self<br>
		And finally, there must remain at last only that which is most reluctant to pass away: the dearest memories, the strongest bonds, the most fundamental desires...
		<br><br>
		It is a slow and terrible process indeed, by which one discovers what one truly is

		The wayward souls who wander the oubliette are found in a variety of forms and states of deterioration, many of which are only dimly perceived by the living.
		<br><br>
		Shades, ghosts, wraiths... such invisible or at least incorporeal apparitions generally cannot appear in bright light, and many cannot be seen by the sane, at least while awake. And in such similar circumstances they cannot harm the flesh, but gnaw upon the soul in places of darkness and when one sleeps without proper precautions. There is an extensive lore of how to avoid the predations of shades, and not all shades are the same
		<br><br>
		A shade that has fed a great deal upon luminosity becomes more real, more substantial. When they become plainly apparent even in bright light, when their hunger for luminosity becomes a hunger for true blood, then it is termed a "ghoul".<br>
		And this process, by which a shade may be anchored once more to the waking world, has been exploited first by the necromancers of Hekkath and later by those of New Tharas and Grayhaven to create servile creatures known as shamblers
		<br><br>
		There are rumors of even more advanced forms, of monstrosities that have devoured so much flesh, so many souls, that at last they become something still more...
