		The wardens are sinister entities who rule over the dark places of the oubliette: ancient guardians of the dominions, bound to the lands and creatures under their care. <br>
		As their realms have withered and twisted under blight and darkness, so have they. 
		<br><br>
		They lurk in dark corners, in deep places and in the black wind, and are always waiting deep beneath the veil of sleep, in the horrible crimson realm of nightmare and fever-dream where the walls of reality have been peeled away
		<br><br>
		It is necessary to appease them where they cannot be avoided, but it is always dangerous to become too familiar. Though in times past they may once have shown benevolence to those who gave proper respect, their hatred and despair have festered for millennia, giving rise at length to madness and obsession. 
		<br><br>
		The lesser ones are capricious creatures, sometimes giving aid, sometimes working mischief, although as the dominions fade they have grown darker and more sinister<br>
		The greater ones are terrible beings, fearful to treat with yet still willing in some cases to give aid to mortals... for a price of course. Others, given over to hatred or hunger prowl the darkness as terrible forces of destruction and subversion, and woe to those who meet them on the road
		<br><br>
		In all cases, their concern for the feeding of the crimson sun has made them bloodthirsty. Fearful sacrifices have been made, and yet still more must be offered in the days to come

		<b>Conceptualized (Demiwarden)</b><br>

		<b>Consecrated (Infrawarden, Lesser Warden)</b><br>

		<b>Exalted (Hierowarden, Greater Warden)</b><br>
		The powers that govern the oubliette and supervise the lesser wardens

		Form is shifting, subject to errors in perception and disemulation. The unseen truth is fixed, bound by burning oaths and secret names. At the core of every warden is an animating principle.<br>
		Though each warden has unique duties and powers, this core serves as a rough form of classification
		<br><br>
		<b>Volition</b><br>
		The force that manifests, by which thoughts are made real
		<br><br>
		<b>Conviction
		</b><br>
		The discernment of truth, the judgement of sins

		<b>Ideation</b><br>
		The conception of possibilities

		The illusions of external reality

		<b>Preservation</b><br>
		The persistence of memory that transcends temporality
		<br><br>
		<b>Cognition</b><br>
		The awareness of internal reality, the cohesion of ideas

		The process of becoming what is not and the abandonment of what has been
