		The blight exists within all the forsaken. A spreading, cancerous rot that inexorably devours its victims from within. It was because of this blight that their ancestors were condemned to the Oubliette without hope of escape or rescue, that the corruption might be contained.
		<br><br>
		It is not known with certainty what causes that latent kernel of darkness to grow within the human heart, but it is dangerous to stay too long in the darkness, to dwell in old places or to heed the whispers of the dead. The first sign is the Dark-fever, which may pass in time, if it is not severe and the victim is kept in the light. Those who survive speak sometimes of a black abyss filled with red stars, others of the dead who spoke to them in the midst of delirium. Those who succumb fully may rave of other things, but they should not be trusted.
		<br><br>
		Those who find the blight manifested on their bodies are sent to wander far from their homes: even death will not prevent the blighted souls from wandering in the darkness, seeking to consume the luminosity of the living. 
		<br><br>
		The Blight can be delayed, but only the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/laudanum">silver laudanum</a> might be said to be a cure, and even that will not avail those who have been utterly consumed.
