	Life and death,<br> waking and dreaming,<br> lucidity and fevered raving...<br> <br>
	the boundaries between these things grow hazy in the darkness.<br> 
	After all, if truth is only what mortal senses perceive, then reality is frail and shifting indeed. 
	<br><br>


	But to say that the senses do not reflect reality is perhaps misleading. Rather to say, that mortal perceptions capture only facets, briefly probing at the surface here and there.<br>
	Sorcerers and demons speak of a world of many shells, of concentric rings of thought, each hiding still more than is revealed. In ignorance, such terms are applied to the dominions, but those who have felt the fevers of the underworld and glimpsed the crimson stars in waking dreams know better. 
	<br>
	Wherever the spirit wanders from the cage of flesh, it may sometimes glimpse these deeper waters.
	<br><br>
	To journey beyond the waking world and peer beyond the veils of living sight is a dangerous endeavor.
	<br>
	The flesh is an anchor: to the world, to the past. Those who drift too far may be lost, or if they return,  may find themselves changed or scarred by what they have seen. And those chasms are not empty. Many of its denizens are hungry for memories and light, to whom the souls of living sleepers are irresistibly appetizing.
