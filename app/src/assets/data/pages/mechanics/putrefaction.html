	The oubliette is in the midst of a long process of spontaneous decay, like a body whose heart has been torn out. All life, all warmth, all magic is slowly fading. Perhaps, it was at work even before the dominions fell. 
	<br><br>
	The wardens have gone to great lengths to arrest this process, but their success was sadly incomplete. Where their power does not reach, or grows dim, the putrefaction spreads quickly, and the wardens themselves are not immune: over millennia of exile, their essence has slowly corroded.
	<br><br>

	The putrefaction is of little concern to shortlived humans and to the gremlins who are well suited to its domain. The beasts of the old magic do not, perhaps, fully understand how they have changed, or remember clearly what they have lost, though they are melancholy and wary when the the flame recedes.
	<br><br>
	To the wardens it is an all-consuming obsession. It is a word that sums up all the tragedy and loss that they have suffered in all these long millennia, and of the dark fate that even now awaits them. To contain it, to delay it, to preserve even the tiniest fragment from it's all-corrupting touch... it is all that remains to them.
