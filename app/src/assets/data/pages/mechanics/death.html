	The cessation of the flesh is not an escape to those trapped in the Oubliette. The spirit that forsakes its flesh, has it torn away by force or withered by time and disease, is doomed to drift forever like flotsam cast from a ship into a shoreless sea: powerless and doomed to a slow dissolution without even the desolate hope of final oblivion. 
	<br><br>
	To call this death, as humans do, is ambiguously accurate, for it is not a true ending. So few things are here, in this place of eternal lingering. Rather, it is only the first stage of a long series of resignations. To lose one's flesh, one's voice, one's name, one's past, one's desires...
	<br> 
	What, indeed, remains in the end? Some say that the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/dregs">Black Dregs</a>, the tormented half-living substance prized by witches and demons, is that very thing: the pure memory, or idea, or soul, that remains after all things rot to nothing.
	<br><br>
	In any event, the boundaries between life and death are blurry here. The term “undead” is sometimes applied to those wretches who exist in one of the intermediate stages of dissolution: The shamblers, the ghouls, the shades... Perhaps other things might rightly be classed here, if they were not so clever at mimicking humanity.
	<br> 
	Those creatures, perhaps, of darkly burning ambition: who cling to life even after the flesh has rotted from their bones, after bone crumbles to dust. 
	<br><br>
	Indeed, after all they have lost, how many of the forsaken truly deserve to be counted among the living? There are many here whose endless drudging through thoughtless eternities persist unchanging throughout the cycles: so many machines of flesh and bone.<br>
	It is a question few wish to answer, and fewer dare to ask.
