		A circle of standing stones which has lain here in darkness since before the first dawn of the crimson sun. Here an oath was betrayed, and here a darker oath sworn in vengeance.

		Since the day the circle was broken, this place has served as the meeting place of the gremlin Shamans when they gather together from their scattered clans to hold council.
		<br><br>
		If there is anything sacred to gremlin-kind, it is this place
