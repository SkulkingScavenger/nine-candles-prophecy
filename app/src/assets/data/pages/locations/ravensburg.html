		The Village of Ravensburg lies at the edge of the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/deadwood-forest">deadwood forest</a>, in the shadow of the Spider Mountains.
		<br><br> 
		The forest is a source of food, light, and building material, but it is also a place of great fear. 
		<br>
		The people of Ravensburg are not hostile to outsiders, but the shadow of their homeland lies over them, leaving them skittish and taciturn.
