	The Village of Ravensburg lies at the edge of the deadwood forest, in the shadow of Spider Mountain.
	<br><br> 
	The forest is a source of food, light, and building material, but it is also a place of great fear. 
	<br>
	The people of Ravensburg are not unfriendly, but the shadow of their homeland lies over them.
