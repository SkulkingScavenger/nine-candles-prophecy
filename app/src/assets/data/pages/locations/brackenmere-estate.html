		There was a time when the Brackenmere estate was renowned as a place of opulence and power, the center of a decadent civilization to rival the villages of the upper oubliette. 
		<br><br>
		That time is long past, and the estate has fallen into darkness and ruin. The final fate of the brackenmere family remains a mystery, and those survivors who fled to <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/new-tharas">New Tharas</a> have proven remarkably tight-lipped and secretive upon the subject. <br><br>
		Perhaps the ignorant peasants simply had no idea what transpired behind the sealed doors of the manor.

		The Brackenmere estate has lain abandoned for centuries. The first wave of looters to venture into the ruins was extensive, but when only a few maddened individuals straggled home with rumors of the most macabre variety, enthusiasm for the project cooled somewhat.
		<br><br>
		The legends of vast treasures still draws ambitious adventurers to the site, albeit with greater caution than their predecessors. Legends of hideous acts of darkest sorcery executed on a mass scale has drawn the attention of a more sinister crowd. While there are a few tales of successful ventures, the general concensus is that the ruins are horribly haunted and that the depths of the estate have yet to be satisfactorily explored.
		<br><br>
		Of the ghosts or demons who inhabit the place, little is known, but there is no lack of speculation. Reports are abundant in quantity and impoverished for quality. The people with the best information have kept it to themselves, for obvious reasons

	<div class="subsection-body">
		The Brackenmere lands were extensive and, at one time, highly developed.<br>
		Spread through a winding vastcavern of many chasms and terraced cliffs, the remains of old thrall-huts still dot the landscape, clustering into a small village around the base of a severe rise, upon which the manor itself is perched.
		<br><br>
		During the age of vicious factional warring, the estate was heavily fortified. Much of the old curtain walls remain intact, though it had begun to fall into disrepair even before the family's withdrawal from society. Past the outer gates lies a meandering garden, pocked with black pits and fissures. 
		<br><br>
		The manor is accessible by a decrepit stairway leading upwards through a series of terraces and terminating in a pillared porch. The doors have long rotted away

	</div>
	<div class="subsection-body">
		The Brackenmere family dominated New Tharas society for centuries. Founders of the powerful Undertakers Guild, they shared power for a time as one of the Three Families during the early period of the village's development. For a period they were virtually supreme, after having ruthlessly supressed their competition within the local morticians and while their primary rivals were occupied with internal divisions.
		<br><br>
		During their heyday, the family's palatial estates expanded dramatically until they became almost a village in their own right. More than one brackenmere patriarch actively schemed to break out of the orbit of New Tharas, particularly after their brutal monopoly began to meet heavy resistance. The family had become known increasingly for its depravity and hedonism, but at the height of their power they made it a fashion.
		<br><br>
		However, the brackenmeres were soon overtaken by their own internal squabblings. A series of insane, sadistic and/or profligate scions eventually squandered their family's position and fell to backstabbing and intrigue over the dwindling remnants.

	</div>
	<div class="subsection-body">
		Though the brackenmere family as a whole remained influential long afterwards, their preeminence had permanently come to an end after they lost control of their guild. From that point onwards they suffered a slow and ugly decline into a stagnant obscurity
		<br><br>
		Rumors of the family's hereditary insanity had been spreading for centuries, and no one would deny the instability and depravity of the family's rulers even by the standards of the Tharasi nobility. However, earlier generations had managed to combine a dissolute lifestyle with political effectiveness and cunning policy. As the family lost it's wealth and central status, the estates became increasingly isolated and some of the relatively sane family members fled to new tharas or hearthfire to escape the horrors of decaying manorial life.
		<br><br>
		In the end the brackenmeres were forgotten by a new generation of Tharasi Magnates and left to fester in their secluded rural outpost. Indeed, it was only after several years had passed that the estate's abandonment was discovered, almost by accident. 
		<br>
		The news of the family's final extinction was met with urbane sneers and idle curiosity from most of their erstwhile peers, and somewhat more active curiosity from opportunistic scavengers and unscrupulous adventurers. Surely something of the fabled Brackenmere wealth might be found in their ancestral seat.
