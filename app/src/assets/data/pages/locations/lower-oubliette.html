		The Deep Oubliette contains the nightmarish realms near the heart of the Oubliette, around the environs of Sinra, Hekkath, and Ahoth. 
		<br><br>
		Here the demons are strongest, the shadows hungriest. Here the darkroots grow hard and thorny and sometimes develop a taste for living flesh. 
		<br>
		The dregs of the upper dominions sink and collect here, and it becomes difficult to sleep at all. Those who dwell here long may find the blight accelerated. 
		<br><br>
		However, there are many lost treasures here, many secrets and strong magic that can be had nowhere else. There are no permanent civilizations of sane humans in the depths, but there will always be those who accept the price of the journey in hopes of great rewards.
