	The air is cold and dry. A scent of of antiquity lies over the dessicated catacombs of Hekkath: The stink of old bones masked by incense and funerary spices as the solemnity of passing years cover over old grief. <br>
	Against the dusty horizon of bonestrewn caverns, featureless monuments rise, their names and purpose forgotten long ago. 
	<br><br>
	Hekkath is a place of austere silence, of inevitable dissolution.<br> 
	A basin into which the fading vitality of the upper regions slowly seeps, that it might be preserved and eternally returned. like sand in an hourglass, it keeps the cycles in their eternal revolutions. 
	<br><br>
	Here in his <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/katharim">tomb-palace</a>, the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/akat">Ghoul King</a> practices his terrible art, and deep, deep below,
	amid ever-sprawling catacombs, a <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/wardens/shathoth">formless horror</a> crawls through an ocean of rotting bones.
