		The Gulf of Spires is a massive <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/stalactite-forest">stalactite forest</a> in the upper oubliette, far to the west. Notably it is home to the village of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/frieberg">Frieberg</a>, whose knights have perched upon its great spires their spindly castles and woven a grand web of sturdy ropes across its great gulfs. 
		<br><br>
		The gulf of spires is also known for its other, more ancient inhabitants, the noble Whitewing Bats, albino cousins of another, <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/blackwings">similarly named species of giant bat</a>. Larger and stronger, but less aggressive towards humans, the Whitewings have bonded with the knights of frieberg over their notions of chivalry and shared hatred of the gremlin marauders who have so often plagued the land.<br> 
		When knight and bat combine their strength, they have found, they make for a fearsome aerial cavalry capable of giving pause even to a Corpseborn Star-eater.
