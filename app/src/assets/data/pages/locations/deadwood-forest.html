		A forest of True Trees, long dead and left to the silence of the abyss
		<br><br>
		for centuries The deadwood forest was kept alive by the magic of the wizard Greenbeard with the help of his allies, the Sorrow Worm Altheia and the great oak Graybark.
		<br><br>
		After the betrayal of the Silver Fountain and the death of Altheia, Greenbeard departed the forest in grief, and left Graybark to his own devices and the steadily fading light.<br><br>
		In the tree equivalent of cannibalism, Graybark sacrificed the better part of the forest to set ablaze the arcane flame that was later to become the False Sun of Zaramon
