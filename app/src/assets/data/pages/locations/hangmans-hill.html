		A sinister monument to a forgotten era of tyranny, a place of sin and punishment without room for redemption. But what redemption could there ever be in a place like this?
		<br><br>
		Hundreds of gibbets still stand, like a forest of leafless trees, though all other trace of civilization has all rotted to nothingness around it, their final victims still hanging mummified where they died so, so long ago. No matter how many come here for judgement, there is always one noose left empty, awaiting a sentence from the condemned
		<br><br>
		For this place draws those oppressed by guilt,driven by the weight of their crimes to ask a final absolution of the thing that sits at the foot of the gallows to grant such wishes
