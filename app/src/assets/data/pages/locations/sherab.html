		Fabled Sherab, the devoured kingdom. The dominion bears its name long after its noble spires have vanished in the mud, along with the bones of its denizens.
		<br><br>
		The uppermost of the dominions, where snow still falls from sunless skies, Sherab is among the more hospitable, and many of the forsaken have taken refuge here. Its caverns are wide, its waters abundant. The snow and mud are a breeding ground for rats and worms and mold, as well as other, more dangerous things. In the vast dark fields at the edges of the dominion, the bleakworms will emerge at intervals, the thunder of their breaching echoing through the caves like distant thunder.
		<br><br>
		And deep beneath the sucking mud, amid layers upon layers of bone-strewn ruins of a hundred dead cities, the slumbering god of rats and worms holds court in pillared labyrinthine halls. To feed the crimson sun, a powerful vessel was required to serve as it's maw, and for this task was chosen Zahastaroth the mighty. Once a wise and glorious lord with his throne among the stars, the archwarden of Sherab is now wretchedly reduced, his mind decayed, his majesty deformed, his wisdom replaced with a mindless and insatiable hunger. From his rotting palace, his servants ascend to prepare the feast of awakening.
