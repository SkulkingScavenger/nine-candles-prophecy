		A <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/biomes/vastcavern">vastcavern</a> located in northern <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/grayhaven">Sherab</a>. It is presently the site of a fortified monastery controlled by the Order of the Silver Fountain
		<br><br>
		Stonetower takes its name from the piled ruins located on an island in the midst of a vast chasm. This position, accessible only by a pair of narrow stone bridges, is easily defensible and has proved an attractive location to settle for many inhabitants over the millennia. It was temporarily occupied by the gremlin horde during the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/history/gremlin-war-1545">war of 1545</a> before it was captured by the Silver Fountain Knights.
		<br><br>
		Prior to this, the cavern had been notorious as the lair of a terrible witchknight who terrorized the realm of sherab for nearly a century before he was finally slain by a nameless knight. For centuries it lay abandoned for fear of the curse said to lie upon the ruins of the sorcerer's castle.
