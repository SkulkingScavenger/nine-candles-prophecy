		A chasm vast as a sea, in whose depths twinkly lights may be seen.<br> 
		They aren't stars of course. Hardly anyone in the oubliette even knows what the stars were supposed to have looked like, unless they have seen the crimson stars that appear to those in the grip of blight-fever. 
		<br><br>
		As a matter of fact, the lights belong to a type of carnivorous, bioluminescent growth covering the surface of a wide pit. The sparkling lights are lures set out for foolish creatures, but they do look pretty from a long distance.
		<br><br>
		The sea of stars is actually mainly known for the legendary gremlin smith who makes her lair in a cave in the cliffs. For one who needs little to be happy but solitude and an abundance of ores, it's certainly an agreeable place. If you do manage to reach the cave, be sure to bring something worth her time.
