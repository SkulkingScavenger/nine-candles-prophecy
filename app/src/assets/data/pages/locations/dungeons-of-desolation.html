		A vast, meandering labyrinth. It's winding, reinforced vaults and dismal cells resemble a prison, but who would need a prison the size of a city? In any event, these days it is home mainly to ghosts and monsters 
		<br><br>
		
		That having been said, a few crazed spirits seem intent on keeping the place operational in spite of its dilapidation and their own deaths.
		<br>
		Thanks to such efforts, it is not uncommon to end an expedition at the bottom of a half-flooded cell with no food or water, surrounded by the gnawed bones of those who likely starved to death before you.
		<br><br>
		Now, such old dungeons are not particularly uncommon in the Oubliette, but there is a peculiar enchantment over these: A dark power slumbers in the depths, bloodthirsty and vengeful.
		<br>
		It drags down the guilty like an anchor to their destruction, to join the legions of crazed shades who wander its corridors
