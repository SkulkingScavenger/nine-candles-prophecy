	The Great City of Grayhaven lies in the upper regions of the oubliette, in the dominion of Sherab.<br>
	Although younger than other nearby civilizations, it has grown quickly into one of the mightiest, it's towering beacons fueled by the vast quantity of darkroot harvested on the borderlands as forests are cleared for farmland to feed its burgeoning population.

	Grayhaven was founded by a legendary figure known to posterity as the Gray Prince, who parted with the craven king of Sanctuary to find Paradise, which he believed lay not far away if only they had the courage to leave the walls. Many listened to his words and followed him, though his rivals feared that only evil would come of such an exodus. When he discovered the cavern of fertile soil, vast forests teeming with plump game, and clear, sweet springs whose waters cured even long-festering diseases, he knew he had discovered what he had been promised. Even the building material was ready to hand, for it seemed that the ruins of an older city lay all about, the stone cunningly cut and perfect for the foundation he wished to lay.

	Today, Grayhaven is the de facto headquarters of two major knightly orders: the grand masters of both the silver fountain and the pale sepulcher make their homes here. 
	The expansion of Grayhaven has come at a cost to its neighbors. The towns of Sanctuary, Wormwood, and winterhall have each come into conflict with the rising kingdom, and each has vanished in turn, their populations pressed into serfdom to pay the debts of their wars, as well as to meet the demand for cheap labor in the newly cultivated darklands, where no hereditary peasants dwell and where mortality rates are high.
