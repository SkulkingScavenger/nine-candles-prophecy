		A sinister castle rises out of the gray wastes of Raishabar, nestled among windy hills. At the base, a dismal cluster of peasant dwellings form a wretched hamlet. <br>
		A typical oubliette outpost, it may appear, but on closer inspection the forsaken who dwell here seem somehow even more sickly and anemic than they do elsewhere, blind and sluggish
		<br><br>
		The village is dark, as fire is forbidden by the lord of the castle. Their bland sustenance of gray, flaky tubers, though abundant in the unusually fertile ash, needs no cooking anyway. The lords themselves are never seen, and indeed, no monsters ever seem to approach that would require the castle's garrison to sally forth. In fact, the castle, dark and silent as it is, seems totally abandoned
		<br><br>
		But the villagers, for all their misery, are quite friendly. They would be honored if you would spend the night. There are spacious rooms available if you wish them. There are always vacancies here in bloodlake village. Why do they call it bloodlake anyway? there are no lakes for miles, even ordinary ones...
