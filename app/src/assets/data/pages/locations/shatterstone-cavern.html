		A <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/biomes/vastcavern">vastcavern</a> in the upper oubliette, home to <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/lanternvale">Lanternvale</a> and its people.
		<br><br>
		It is so named on account of the wide chasms that divide the cavern floor into great plateaus, dotted with ruins and spanned by old stone bridges.
		These chasms were carved by the Styx, one of the great subterranean rivers of the Oubliette, whose waters run their turgid course deep below the surface
