	In the upper Oubliette, somewhere past Korhazar far to the west, there lies a vast cavern known as the gulf of spires. There, vast stalagmites and stalactites rise like mountainous islands from a sea of darkness, like slender pillars in a hall of giants, like the needle-sharp fangs of some impossibly vast stone beast.
	<br><br>
	Nestled among these great icicles of living stone is the small but independent kingdom of Frieberg. Little more than a village, perched precariously upon the Lonely Stalagmite, it can be seen from a great distance by the welcoming light of its great beacons. 
	<br><br>
	Frieberg is known for the courage of its knightly class, the benevolence and wisdom of its kings. Together they defend the independence of their homeland fiercely against those powers who would conquer it. Over the generations, the knights of Frieberg have come to an arrangement with the great albino bats who nest in the stalagmites near their homeland.
