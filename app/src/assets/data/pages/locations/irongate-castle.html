		Irongate Castle is the ancestral seat of the haunted von Schwarzschild family and administrative center of the eponymous <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/grayhaven">Grayhaven</a> barony.
		<br><br>
		The castle lies on the far northern border of Grayhaven Territory, well out of sight of the city's beacons and butting up against a vast wilderness of darkroot and mouldering ruins. Like most such darkland castles, it is well fortified and equipped with towering beacons that illuminate the surrounding farmland and provide a sense of time and direction to the vassals and serfs who are bound to it.
