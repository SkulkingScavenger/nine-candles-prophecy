		In the oubliette, only two True Trees remain alive: the black tree of the East and the white tree of the West.<br>
		At the very edge of the oubliette, far, far beyond all dominions there stands the White Tree: The Tree of Sorrows.
		<br><br>
		Born of the moon's sorrow and watered by her silver tears, planted in memory of a murdered sun that shall never shine again. A power of protection lies in it still, proof against the poison of the black lake and the corrupting blight
		<br><br>
		Once every hundred years the tree bears a silver fruit and in its heart there lives a seed of hope, a final gift to all who wander in forlorn exile
