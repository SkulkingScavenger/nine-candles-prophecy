	Tucked away amid the ruins of Korhazar, the village of bleaklight is a dusty, haunted place. Many pale threads bind the cobbled streets and crumbling houses, lest they wander in the shifting shadows. It's people are furtive and mistrustful, but wise and crafty. They know many secret things, of anchors and chains.
