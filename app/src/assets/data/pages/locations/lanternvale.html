	A peaceful starting village, a hub for wanderers and a place for adventurers to sell their goods.

	Lanternvale lies in the midst of a wide flatlands within the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/shatterstone-cavern">shatterstone cavern</a>, butted up on one side against the cavern walls, and defended upon others by one of its meandering chasms, at the bottom of which flows the Dustharrow River.

	It is an ancient town, one of many built by refugees from Raishabar thousands of years ago, and time has not been gentle to it. It is a place of quiet fading, of somber, dignified resignation and dusty traditions. The weight of centuries hangs over it. 
	<br><br>
	And yet, if it's inhabitants are not known for their liveliness, there are many who are drawn to its tranquility. Here the lanterns are kept lit through the long dark, awaiting the return of those poor souls who have suffered the terror of the deep places or the lingering malice of the old kingdoms
	And so throughout it's history, lanternvale has served as a hub for travelers, a place of trade, recovery, and rest. A place for adventures to begin, and to end
