		In the endless, torturous <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/mechanics/the-shifting">churning and contortions</a> of the oubliette, the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/biomes/ruins">ruins</a> of past civilizations may be found to slowly migrate.<br> 
		For those who cling to their villages, such forces seem merely random, but the navigators know that this amnesiac force obeys its own strange laws, moving in a dance of unseen elegance to a silent rhythm. 
		<br><br>
		And so it is that there are certain loci, places where some strange confluence of forces forms a sort of doldrums or vortex within the oubliette. places where old debris collects unmoving, except perhaps to sink
		<br><br>
		The most notorious of such places is known as The Jumble

		The Jumble is a vast heap of ruination, formed from the compacted stone carcasses of a thousand civilizations. It stretches on and on like a mountain range, up and down and in all directions. There are some who say it is growing, and there are concerns that it might never stop, that perhaps it and its kind represent a new, more aggressive phase of the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/mechanics/putrefaction">putrefaction</a>
		<br>
		It is, after all, the sort of thing that might happen down here
		<br><br>
		although seldom does anything escape the jumble, In many ways the shifting is not so much diminished as intensified to a small point, such that its distortions of space are plainly visible. Stairs go up and down in both direction. A door before you exits from a wall behind. A narrow closet contains a cathedral.
		<br>
		And not only are such changes more extreme, but they also occur much more rapidly. Great care must be taken that the stairs that were taking you to a floor above when you began does not lead to the basement by the time you end. 
		<br><br>
		All in all, it's the sort of place that could drive one mad, and the creatures who make there homes here are indeed a mad lot.
		<br><br> 
		It should come as no surprise that very few people ever come here on purpose.
