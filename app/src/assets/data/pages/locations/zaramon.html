		A sinister labyrinth of meandering chasms and cobwebbed corridors, infested by blind burrowing things, hunting and feeding amid the sinister darkroot. 
		<br><br>
		The tunnels of Zaramon have proven a particularly attractive nesting site for the oubliette's giant spiders, and was the original home of the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/murkweavers">murkweavers</a>, though they have since spread well beyond. 
		<br><br>
		Despite the abundance of evil spirits and the size of its arachnids, the forsaken have continued to maintain outposts within the dominion's twisted groves. The spiders are actually something of a mixed blessing: The relatively docile <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/silkspinners">silkspinners</a> cultivated in the upper oubliette produce silk abundantly but the quality cannot compare to that produced by the monstrosities of Zaramon. The darkroot grows thick and thorny here as well, producing sturdy boards and dense, long-burning oil.
