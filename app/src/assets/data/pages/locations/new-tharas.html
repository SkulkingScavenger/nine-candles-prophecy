	Not far from the cursed and sunken ruins of the older city whose dubious legacy it claims, the pale lights and beacons of New Tharas gleam like will-o-wisps from its dark isle, reflected eerily upon the still surface of the subterranean lake.

	The town was built long ago by outcasts from Hearthfire. A place of evil reputation, it now serves as a dark hub for those whose presence is unwelcome in Grayhaven and Lanternvale. Thieves, murderers, navigators, witches and gremlins sell their wares and their services to those with the gold and the stomach to deal with them. Many things are for sale here openly that cannot be purchased elsewhere.

	Founded by criminals, for criminals, the place has a fundamentally lawless character. But in the interest of protecting commerce, certain local powers have united to provide a functional degree of order within the town itself. This de-facto government includes representative from the Gremlins of the Kirrikash Clan, the Knife & Candle, the wizards' circle, The navigators and undertakers guilds, the Hundred Whispers, and an assortment of local magnates: mercenary captains, major merchants, various influential swamp creatures and a few of what are widely believed to be wardens.
