#INFOBOX_END
	The <b>Gremlin War of 1545</b> was a conflict fought largely within the lands north of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/grayhaven">Grayhaven City</a>, in the principalities of Harrowfeld, Grimmelbach, and Northelm, between the lords of Grayhaven and the gremlin clans united under Warlord Ear-taker.
	<br><br>
	The War was the first confrontation of comparable scope between the gremlin clans and a forsaken civilization in over three centuries, and besides the vast loss of life, had grave political and economic consequences for the kingdom of Grayhaven, pushing the city ever closer to ending promised at the end of the cycle.

	</div>
	<div class="subsection-body">
		Almost since the foundation of the city, the darklands of Grayhaven have been subject to sporadic gremlin raids, particularly from the Magakash and Ragakor Clans based nearby. For centuries, however, these raiders had been content to opportunistically pick off vulnerable targets on the borderlands, avoiding fortified positions in favor of poorly defended villages and ambushing travelers in poorly lit regions.
		<br><br>
		In response to these depredations, the lords of the darklands had occasionally launched retaliatory expeditions to uproot gremlin hideouts and preemptively deter raiding. These attempts met with mixed success, and while a few gremlin Huntsmasters were captured or a lair destroyed, none ever penetrated to the clan strongholds deeper in the oubliette. 
		<br>
		Ultimately, such skirmishes were viewed as a fact of life by both parties. The lords of brightlands were unwilling to expend resources to improve what seemed an incurable position, and the darkland lords were generally unable to overcome their mutual distrust sufficiently to organize a decisive counterattack. 
		<br><br>
		However, the Gremlin Shamans had long been wary of the expanding power of the Sherab Wardens, aware that the Cycle was drawing to its close and knowing well the terror that would follow the waking of The Worm. For a long time, the wardens had been held in check by the sacrifice of the Gray King and his descendants, but with the resurrection of Lord Kyrioth in 1532 even that seal had begun to weaken.
		<br><br> 
		Thus in 1543, the Council of Shamans summoned the well-regarded Chieftain of the Hazashakiri, Ear-taker, and implored him to accept the mantle of Warlord, unite the clans, and lead a full-scale assault on the doomed city of Grayhaven

	<div class="subsection-body">
		The initial gremlin onslaught came as a surprise. Ear-taker had intentionally lulled the defenders of the borderlands into a false sense of security, sending out feeble raiding parties to feel out the enemy's weak points, only gradually comitting his forces in dispersed fashion. The first major attacks were aimed at relatively defenseless settlements and left few survivors<br>
		Thus it was only slowly that the Grayhaveners realized the magnitude of the threat.
		<br><br> 
		Only after Ear-taker had taken several outlying castles, having already exposed his core forces and siege apparatus, did the lords of grayhaven realize that things had escalated well beyond the ordinary darkland skirmishes.
		<br>
		Even then, the lords dwelling in the better protected and more affluent brightlands paid little attention, and left their more remote countrymen to deal with the threat on their own, nor could the jealous and mutually distrustful darklanders organize themselves effectively until many years had passed and the north had been utterly devastated.

	<div class="subsection-body">
		The first serious response to the Gremlin assault was undertaken by the Grand Master of the Silver Fountain, <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/hochmeister-dietrich">Dietrich von Winterhof</a>, who led a force of 500 knights to relieve the siege of Marlbranc.
		<br>
		He then remained in the area and attempted to rally the local lords, with some success. His efforts were limited largely to the east, after he became tied down by the loss of intermediate castles and Ear-taker's orders to dig up the major roads connecting the eastern and western darklands and destroy the beacons.

		<br><br>
		In the west, the gremlins had long found their progress hopelessly blocked by the black knights of westcavern and the fanatical forces of the sable dogma, and Ear-taker had long feared that if the castles of Wrackmoor and Westcavern could not be captured, they would be continuously exposed to flank attacks. However, after the first failed assault, <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/klaus-von-nachtstein">the Count</a> sent back several of the captured raiders with a message requesting a parley. Ear-taker warily agreed to meet Count von Nachtstein at a secret location deep in the Black Forest, where the count offered a particularly treasonous secret alliance. Ear-taker ultimately saw no choice but to accept, though both sides secretly plotted betrayal at a future date. Afterwards, they coordinated to distribute damage along strategic routes that passed through lands held by Count Westcaverns most troublesome neighbors and leaving those of his affinity relatively untouched. In exchange, Westcavern offered intelligence provided by his spies within the city, and turned a deaf ear to pleas from other darkland lords to harass the gremlins from the west.

		<h3 class="subsection-title" id="the_tides_turn">The Tides Turn (1549-1550)</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="subsection-body">
		By 1549, The gremlins had thoroughly devastated the northern darklands and plundered the relatively untouched brightlands of the inner caverns, fighting within sight of the city walls.
		<br>
		Although the princes had begun to take the situation seriously as early as the sack of Duskhollow, the fear of an opportunistic attack from their southern neighbors (who had been relatively untouched) had prevented Harrowfeld and Grimmelbach from comitting their full forces to the defense of the northlands.
		<br><br>
		Now that it had become obvious to all that the darklanders had failed to contain the threat, the princes quickly put aside their factional squabbling. Heavily reinforced by volunteers from the affinities of the other princes, Grimmelbach and Harrowfeld at last sallied forth on a joint expedition to push back the invaders.
		<br><br>
		Ear-taker had expected such retaliation for some time, and pulled his forces back into the north, hoping to draw out the princes into desolate regions where they could be cut off by his skirmishers and left to starve in the oubliette.
		<br><br>
		These plans met with an unexpected setback. After the main hosts had scattered with orders to regroup in the north, Baron Otto von Schwarzschild, whose lands Ear-taker had ignored after they had heroically rebuffed all of his assaults, marshalled the broken and desperate survivors into a cohesive fighting force to harry the gremlins on their route.
		<br><br>
		This event marked the beginning of Lord Kyrioth's direct interference in the war, previously limited to the defense of the von Scwhwarzschild lands. After a gruesome ritual offering in the basement of Castle Irongate, Kyrioth fully possessed Baron von Schwarzschild and proceeded to hunt down and kill several gremlin chieftains

		Meanwhile, <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/gray-eyes">Gray-eyes the Seer</a>, the Magakash Shaman, met secretly with Count Westcavern, informing him of the internal situation among the gremlin hosts and inviting him to break his current truce with Ear-taker and rejoin the war. The count, eager to be the first to break faith, accepted.<br> In a particularly underhanded move, the Count moved his forces deep into gremlin territory unannounced and with lightning speed to sack the entire settlement of Rotwall, whose position was revealed by Gray-eyes. The Count and his forces slaughtered the inhabitants and occupied it in the name of Prince Grimmelbach.<br><br> 
		This attack from an unexpected quarter fatally compromised Eartaker's western defenses, forcing him to retreat still further. Hoping to wear down his pursuers and harry them on their way home, Ear-taker set up base in <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/stonetower-cavern">Stonetower Cavern</a>, rebuilding the fortifications and filling the nearby ruins with hunters and marksmen.

	<div class="subsection-body">
		In the summer of 1550, the united forces of the Silver Knights and Prince Harrowfeld pursued the Gremlin Host into the remote north and besieged Ear-taker's base at Stonetower, while Prince Grimmelbach defended the flank.
		<br><br>
		After a season of fierce fighting, the besiegers captured Stonetower Fortress, a hastily renovated structure built on an island amidst a vast chasm. However, the besiegers were overwhelmed by disease and had taken heavy casualties. Ear-taker had been taken off guard by the loss of Stonetower Fortress and the betrayal of Count Westcavern, and was now unable to follow through with his plan to harry the Grayhaven supply lines. On September 9th, Both sides settled down for what looked like a bitter stalemate.
		<br><br>
		However, shortly afterwards, the gremlins abandoned their positions, vanishing as suddenly as they had arrived. Suspecting a trap, the Grayhaven forces remained in the northlands well into autumn before warily disbanding, leaving the Order of the Silver Fountain to hold Stonetower as an outpost
		<br><br>
		Although the strength of the invaders remained unbroken (a fact that left many deeply uneasy) the Princes declared a decisive victory on October 25th and returned to Grayhaven in great honor.

		<h3 class="subsection-title" id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="subsection-body">
		While the gremlin clans ultimately abandoned the campaign without besieging Grayhaven itself and the war ended with significant territorial gains for the silver fountain, the individual gremlin clans came away substantially enriched while the lands in which the war had been fought were left depopulated and impoverished.
		Human Casualties, both civilian and military were dramatically higher than the gremlins, including thousands of knights and lords. 
		<br><br>
		Thus, viewed as a large-scale raiding operation, the war was a decisive gremlin victory
		<br><br>
		Nevertheless, Ear-taker's decision to quit while he was ahead was viewed disapprovingly by many raiders who believed that the defenders were on the brink of collapse and that the city itself, wracked by plague and infighting among the princes, was within their grasp.<br> 
		One of the most prominent of Ear-taker's chieftains, <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/throatbiter">Throatbiter Magakashi</a>, challenged him to single combat for the title of warlord, in which Ear-taker was slain. Thus what was arguably the most ambitious raiding operation in three centuries came to a surprisingly inglorious end.
		<br><br>
		Despite the verbal agreement between the two combatants, Throatbiter's claim to succeed Ear-taker as warlord was ignored by a majority of the clans, who considered throatbiter's brutish resolution of the conflict to be in exceedingly bad taste.<br> Whatever they thought of the retreat, Ear-taker had been revered for the exceptional leadership and masterful tactics that had resulted in so many glorious victories. Even among those who had wished to continue the war, many refused to cooperate with throatbiter, viewing him as unfit to lead.
		<br><br>
		The departure of these clans, including most of the best siege-engineers, left Throatbiter in a difficult situation: He had seized power on the promise of continuing the war, but now found himself without the strength to do so.
		<br>
		Frustrated, but obeying the council of his advisor, Gray-eyes, Throatbiter constructed fortifications near Grayhaven but delayed the attack until further reinforcements could be gathered, and for all intents the war came to an end regardless
		<br><br>
		Eager to prevent a repitition of the invasion, The Order of the Silver Fountain occupied Stonetower Cavern, establishing a major convent among the ruins
		<br><br>
		While the princes had united temporarily during the emergency, the unequal distribution of devastation, concentrated heavily in the Harrowfeld Principality, unsettled the already uneasy balance of powers obtaining in Grayhaven. 
		<br>
		Incidents during the war led to an improvement in relations between harrowfeld and the grand master of the silver fountain, and ultimately led to the end of the longstanding hostilities between Prince harrowfeld and Prince Northelm. However, the rift between Grimmelbach and Harrowfeld widened to an extent that at times threatened an outbreak of open war, due to mutual accusations of treachery and bitter disagreement over territories reclaimed from the gremlins.
		<br><br>
		Significantly, in an attempt to broker a peaceful resolution to the question of desolate lands reclaimed by the gremlins, Grand Master Dietrich was chosen to arbitrate as a neutral party.<br>
		However, his final decision to restore the borders as they had existed before 1545, while calculated to prevent the collapse of the earlier balance of power, was disproportionately advantageous to Prince Harrowfeld, who had lost the most by the wartime redistribution, and badly embarrassed Prince Grimmelbach who had (prematurely, but perhaps hoping to complicate just such a ruling) in many cases already promised the lands to his vassals.<br> 
		Although some attempts were made to compensate Prince Grimmelbach, the war had left Harrowfeld in a poor position to lavish gifts on his rivals and the token payments did little to sooth the ire of Grimmelbach's dispossessed vassals.
