		In many places, the caverns or tunnels of the Oubliette are interrupted by the presence of vast, lightless pits.<br>
		Some are formed from <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/mechanics/weather#skyfall">Skyfall</a> as it crashes precipitously into the depths, others by the relatively natural erosion of great subterranean rivers in primordial eras of cataclysmic floods. Some are simply holes in reality itself, bottomless voids eaten away by the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/mechanics/putrefaction">putrefaction</a>.
		<br><br>
		Regardless of the cause, these voids are a cause of great distress to travelers who come upon them unexpectedly. There is no absolute limit to how far they may span in any direction, and they can be perilous to cross, even where narrow paths may yet provide an obvious means of transit: Who knows how much more those unsupported stones may bear before they too vanish into the darkness below? And who can say what may become of one who falls into such unknown gulfs, which even the wardens are said to fear.
