Vastcaverns are very large caverns.
<br><br>

The exact definition is vague, but one navigator's definition is a cave so large that if you lit a large fire at the center you could see neither the walls nor the ceiling. Another is any cave large enough to have clouds, although in drier areas this can be hard to assess.
<br><br> 
Vastcaverns are important landmarks, and a favored place to build large settlements
