		Pits full of bones are uncomfortably common in the oubliette. A great many things have died here through the long cycles, and so much of such mortal debris has sunken.
		<br><br>
		There is a tendency for old, forgotten and unneeded things to gather together. Where so many sad remnants have accumulated, a sort of gravitation calls out to other fading things:<br>
		"Come, this is a place to die and be forgotten"
		<br><br>
		Such natural ossuaries have some attraction for the living as well. After all, not everyone dies penniless, and there is no telling what treasures might lie buried among old bones. And (it scarcely needs saying) if you happen to have a use for osseous material, you can hardly do better.
		<br>
		And finally, for some mysterious reason, <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/dregs">black dregs</a> have been known to accumulate at the bottom of such pits. 
		<br><br>
		Of course, one must be careful: there are plenty of creatures who see nothing wrong with making a home of someone's old ribcage or eye-socket (in the case of certain monsters, such accomodations may be quite spacious), and there are a few horrors who specifically lair in such places, swimming through old bones like fish in a lake
