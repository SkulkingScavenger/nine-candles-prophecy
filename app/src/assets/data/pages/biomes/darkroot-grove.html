Darkroot is common enough as a resource, but it tends to grow in patches. 
<br><br>
It does not seem to need water or organic matter, and its method of germination seems almost spontaneous, but for some reason it can be found in abundance in some areas, scarcely in others, and not at all in many. Darkroot groves are thus an important resource to locate.
<br><br>
Darkroot is a highly variable plant.
<br> 
In the upper and outer regions, it is typically slender and oddly supple, dangling like vines or shooting up like saplings, or creeping across the ground like errant shadows. 
<br><br>
In the interior it grows thicker and tougher: its bark sometimes forming a stony shell of glistening black, other times thorns of bitter sharpness.<br> It twitches and weeps strangely when chopped.
<br><br>
In the depths, there are stories of impassible living caverns where the darkroot twists and weaves into itself, growing fanged tendrils of living wood that lash out of their own accord to ensnare passing creatures of flesh.
