The fabled Forest of Lights is an obvious example, but most glowing caverns are not so ostentatious. The most common species of glowing mushroom gives off only a simple blue-white light.
These caves are much rarer than ordinary mushroom forests (perhaps 15% of mushroom forests are luminous) and generally do not overlap, as the giant mushrooms tend to squeeze out their smaller, more delicate cousins.
