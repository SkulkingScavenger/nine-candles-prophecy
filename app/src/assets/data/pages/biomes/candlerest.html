		places of pale cool light and solemn silence, a candlerest is a churchyard maintained by one of the surviving Gravekeepers.<br> 
		Though their primary purpose is to provide a place of rest to the weary dead and thus poorly equipped to attend the hungers of the flesh, the gravekeepers do not turn aside the living who ask for sanctuary. In the deep places, these are the only places of real safety.
		<br><br>
		Navigators and other lost souls often visit these places in their wanderings. Indeed, they are the closest thing to a social hub outside the beacons of the villages, though the atmosphere is more like a church than a tavern. 
		<br><br>
		Candlerests are protected by the enchantments of the gravekeepers. Neither warden nor shade nor any creature of nightmare has any power to harm those within its light. Those who come bearing violence in their hearts will never find them in the first place
