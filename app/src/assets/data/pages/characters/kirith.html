#INFOBOX_END

From the rotting marshes of the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/tharas">Drowned Kingdom</a>, the accursed sorcerer Kirith rides forth to work his master's evil upon the realms of mankind.
<br><br>
This depraved and deathless slave of the Archwarden <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/shiragazira">Shiragazira</a> was once a consecrated monk-knight of the Order of the Silver Fountain. Out of lust for forbidden knowledge, he betrayed his brethren, abandoned his vows and sacrificed his own humanity.
<br><br>
He knows nothing of honor, using a poisoned whip, a surprisingly high stamina, and a variety of bullshit cheese tactics to avoid ever having to learn to parry. His name is cursed everywhere

	<div class="subsection-body">
		Lord Shiragazira has two obsessions, and that means Kirith does too, whether he likes it or not.
		<br><br>
		The village of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/hearthfire">Hearthfire</a>, and all the souls within, rightfully belong to Tharas. The fact that they remain independent, after abandoning the old ways and neglecting the ancient rites and tribute, is a source of great fury to the Black Devourer.
		<br><br>
		Although unable to launch a direct assault upon the village on account of its ancient enchantment, Shiragazira has set her mightiest wraith to plague the surrounding lands, to subvert the villagers by any and all means. And so the sinister old tower of bleakmoor, long abandoned, has become once again an object of terror and dark legend.

		<h3 class="subsection-title">Quest for the Prisoners' thorns</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="subsection-body">
		Long, long ago, when the priests of Hekkath waged their war of sacrifice across the oubliette, they were opposed by the seven knightly orders<br>
		In answer, the wardens created an order of their own.<br><br>
		Though they terrorized the oubliette for thousands of years, one by one the witchknights fell, and the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/artifacts/prisoners-thorns">prisoners' thorns</a> were lost and scattered.
		<br>
		This represents a serious loss as well as something of a liability to the wardens, who have been at pains to account for them. Lord Shiragazira takes a particular interest in the fate of the thorns, desiring them for her necromantic experiments.
		<br><br>
		As most of Shiragazira's minions are unable or unwilling to leave her dominion, it has largely fallen to Kirith to follow up on reports or hints of their reappearance

		When after so many long centuries have passed, the enchantment protecting Hearthfire had begun to dim: The seed, gifted by the queen of the sorrow worms and planted by a wandering wizard at the foundation of the village had grown old and soon would pass away. Another perilous journey was planned to travel to the edge of the world and ask a boon of the Tree of Sorrows. 
		<br><br>
		It was not lost on Lord Shiragazira that if this quest should fail, it would be game over for hearthfire. Guess whose job it was to make sure it happened.
