#INFOBOX_END
	Hailing from the haunted darklands far to the north of Grayhaven, Count Westcavern has earned a sinister reputation in the course of a particularly dark and bloody career.
	<br><br>
	In the courts of the princes, he is a controversial figure, both respected and feared for his shrewd diplomacy, his hypnotic charm, his scandalous connections with New Tharasi merchants and his legendary expeditions deep into the oubliette.
	<br><br>
	Among his darklands neighbors, he is the object of grave terror: For the swiftness and brutality of his knights, for the thoroughness, and sometimes subtlety, by which he arranges the downfalls of his rivals. For the unsettling frequency with which he entertains guests from New Tharas' most notorious assassin's guilds.
	<br><br>
	In his own lands, whenever a peasant goes missing, it is a matter of common superstition among the villagers to blame it on the count, prowling in the form of a beast to slake his thirst for human blood
	<br><br>
	It just seems like something he would do

	<div class="subsection-body">
		Count Westcavern's lands and interests lie far to the north of Grayhaven, near the territorial divide between the principalities of Grimmelbach and Harrowfeld and extending deep into the wilderness.<br> 
		One of the more successful of the border lords, von Nachtstein runs a well-oiled military machine which has proven itself more than once against substantially larger forces. Yet despite (or perhaps because of) this position of strength, the count has lately shifted from a policy of military aggression and territorial expansion to one of diplomatic intervention.<br> 
		He holds some lands in fee of Prince Grimmelbach and is counted among his affinity, but is generally thought of as more independent. Though he has yet to openly defy his nominal prince, this independence has allowed him a free hand to arbitrate in the often bitter squabblings across factional boundaries.
		<br><br>
		Count Westcavern's chief allies are the Duke of Falstein, the Count of Saroburg and the Baron of Isengrim, men of Grimmelbach's affinity who have increasingly come to be viewed as a distinct faction of their own. <br>
		Though the membership are keen to insist that there is nothing unusually formal about their mutual alliances, their coordination in exerting pressure on adjacent houses, and the potential difficulties their union might pose to Prince Grimmelbach, should their interests ever come into serious conflict, has been widely noted.<br> The prince himself has wisely avoided antagonizing the bloc thus far, and for their own part, the darklander lords seem content to concentrate their resources on securing the northern borders, an occupation few could complain of.

			</div>
		</div>
		von Nachtstein's other allies are a bit more controversial.<br> 
		There are constant rumors about his dealings with Tharasi merchants, and the unusual passivity from the local gremlin clans, the shockingly heathen behavior observed in some of the villages near castle Nachtstein or among his closest knights. 
		<br>
		The Count, of course, has convincing answers to all such accusations. In any event, the conditions that prevail in the darklands are generally desperate enough that his immediate neighbors have no room to judge a man for resorting to their means of survival, and he is far enough from the brightlands that the Inquisitors of the Pale Knights have never found time to follow up on the rumors
		<br>
		...or perhaps they fear what they might uncover, should they press too deeply.
		<br><br>
		To the minor lords who live nearby, Count Westcavern is an ambiguous boon. His powerful presence on the borders serves as a bulwark against both the creatures of the outer darkness and the ever greedier hunger of the grayhaven princes.<br> 
		The count's considerable wealth, an anomaly in a region of barren soil and subject to constant raiding by monsters and bandits, combined with his insatiable demand for mercenaries, is for many the only thing keeping them out of bankruptcy and thralldom.<br>
		And yet, it is difficult not to feel that the count might yet prove the most dangerous and inescapable enemy of all

	<div class="subsection-body">
		
		The von Nachtsteins are an old family, once glorious, but brought by long centuries of misfortune and hereditary madness to the brink of extermination.<br> 
		The previous Count of Westcavern, Morgan von Nachtstein, was reported to have murdered his wife and most of his children in a fit of madness before drowning himself, nearly ending the dynasty in a stroke. Klaus alone survived to inherit the derelict county, having been serving an apprenticeship at castle falstein at the time of the tragedy.
		<br><br>
		Few expected the family to make such a sudden and violent comeback under Morgan's melancholic younger son.

	<div class="subsection-body">
		
		Despite a rough start, Klaus has worked tirelessly to repair his family's withered status, in the course of which he has established a reputation for ruthlessness and duplicity. credited by his allies as a master tactician. Not one to be trifled with.
		<br><br>

		The first years of his reign were marked by a period of fierce territorial conflict. Several neighboring lords had attempted throughout the years to encroach upon the lands of the dying house, and after Morgan's death many believed the time had come to put it out of its misery.<br> 
		However, far from a merciful execution, these raids escalated into a long series of exceedingly desperate feuds, from which Klaus emerged not only decisively victorious, but as the sole surviving belligerent.
		<br><br>
		In the beginning of the war, The Count was on the defensive, but over the course of almost a decade the tides turned and one by one Klaus crushed his rivals with a horrible thoroughness
		<br>
		Disunified opportunists, his opponents soon lost the stomach for battle after realizing too late what a terrible beast they had cornered. Their defeats only whetted the count's appetite, however. Many foolishly accepted truces while von Nachtstein dealt with would-be allies, only to find themselves isolated when their own turn came.<br>
		During this period, Klaus made a policy of total annihilation. While justifying his war on grounds of reclaiming stolen lands and restitution for past raids, Klaus had no intention of leaving himself surrounded by wary and resentful former-enemies. Insisting on the extermination of entire bloodlines, Klaus accepted neither ransoms nor surrender and hounded survivors to their deaths, executing them in public or sending assassins to hunt them down in exile. It was this as much as anything that first earned him a reputation as a cold-blooded murderer, and a relentless enemy.
		<br><br>
		After 9 years of continuous warfare, Count Westcavern emerged with vastly expanded territories and substantially wealthier, having absorbed the resources of seven darkland houses.<br>
		During this time he had cultivated important allies among his peers and established his reputation among both local mercenaries and foreign traders, taking time to travel in person to New Tharas on multiple occasions.<br>

		<br><br>
		Not content to rest on his achievements, after a short respite he embarked on an aggressive campaign of territorial conquest aimed deep in the northern wilderness.<br> 
		An absurdly dangerous undertaking on its own, von Nachtstein earned everlasting notoriety by actively hunting the local gremlin clans.<br> 
		Desperate to offset the breathtaking mortality rates, von Nachtstein summoned rogue knights, runaway thralls and desperate characters from throughout the darklands, promising knighthood and a fief to any who survived to the end of the war
		<br><br>

			</div>
		</div>
		Though the staggering costs of the project were dubiously offset by the territorial gains of unpopulated and untamed wastes, this served as a crucial step in what came after.
		<br><br>
		Importantly, these wars laid the foundation of an independent territory, won by conquest rather than held in fief. They also built the core of von Nachtstein's war machine:
		<br> 
		The Black Knights of Westcavern, hardened veterans of inhuman warfare fought in the pitchy blackness beyond the beacon light, touched by the blight and their master's twisted teachings.<br> They would always remember who had called them out of slavery, led them into the dark pits of madness and witchcraft, whispered to them of things that must never be thought or spoken by mortals, and led them back alive to positions of power and authority:
		<br>
		Count Westcavern, the mad, the accursed, the invincible

		<h3 class="subsection-title" id="the-gremlin-war">The Gremlin War of 1545</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="subsection-body">
		Klaus' behavior during the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/history/gremlin-war-1545">Gremlin War</a> was controversial, but perhaps predictable.<br>
		Having established his own lands as a secure bastion against gremlin assault early on, Klaus proceeded to take a backseat to the fighting until near the end of the war, holding his forces in reserve and venturing forth only to secure or maintain strategically valuable alliances. While those under his protection praised his foresight in securing the northwest and saving his strength for a decisive, killing stroke, most took a dim view of his sudden inaction, crediting the count's depraved politics rather than his strategic acumen for the manner in which he left his countrymen to die at the hands of the inhuman invaders.
		<br><br>
		However, his devastating reentry in 1550 to strike a fatal blow at the gremlin flank ultimately silenced those who had earlier accused him of treason.
		<br><br>
		And even among his greatest detractors, few ever guessed the true extent of the count's treachery...

		People who speak with Klaus for the first time often have difficulty connecting the slight, soft-spoken nobleman with the bloodsoaked warlord suggested by his reputation.
		<br><br>
		Clearly, the uncivilized darklanders are exaggerating and slandering (as they do)
		<br><br>
		He is certainly well educated, remarkably cool-headed, and highly empathetic<br>
		Which is to say, he is an excellent liar who always knows exactly what to say and how to say it to get the results he needs, and rarely makes foolish mistakes.<br> 
		Mistakes such as pity, remorse, love, or chivalry are <i>particularly</i> rare
		<br><br>
		His talents for darklands warfare are not exaggerated, and in fact are a little underrated (just as planned). While mediocre physically, he is devilishly cunning and shockingly bold. His tactics are brutally psychological, always striking a little deeper and faster than his enemies expect, or from an unexpected quarter, or by unexpected means, without regard for personal risk. He carefully cultivates an aura of fear and uncertainty, always forcing his enemies on the defensive even before the fighting begins, even before war is declared.
