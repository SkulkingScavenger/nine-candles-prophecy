		Alfred Fletcher awoke with the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/mechanics/shademark">shademark</a> in a <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/biomes/candlerest">candlerest</a> near <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/dominions/maelech">Maelech</a>, without any memory of his past life.
		<br><br>
		Rather than hire himself out as a navigator, Fletcher has dedicated himself to the study of the ruins, hoping to learn something of his past lives and the enigmatic messages he believes he wrote to himself in anticipation of his present amnesia. He believes he may be close to a great and terrible discovery regarding the true nature of the Oubliette
		<br><br>
		While investigating the ancient complex known as the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/dungeons-of-desolation">Dungeons of Desolation</a>, Fletcher joined forces with the enigmatic <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/marlok">Marlok</a>, whose condition was surprisingly similar to his own. Fletcher has a suspicion that Marlok's quest may yield insight into his own burning questions, and that their meeting may not have been such a coincidence as it seemed at first.
