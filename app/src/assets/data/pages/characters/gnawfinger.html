		A mysterious gremlin hermit who wanders alone deep in the oubliette.<br>
		So named, no doubt, for his idle habit of gnawing at his claws
		<br><br>
		Gnawfinger is well known among navigators and other such solitary wanderers who frequent the candlerests, where he can rarely be found.<br> He is on unusually good terms with both humans and gravekeepers for a gremlin (Which isn't saying much, mind you), so that some wonder if he was perhaps exiled from his own kind for some unknown gremlin crime.<br>
		Unlike other gremlins, he does not eat human flesh, allegedly due to a promise he made long ago, but whatever the reason it has done wonders for his diplomatic standing.
		<br><br>
		This is not to say he has any close friends, and in fact he keeps up a grim silence most of the time, which few are willing to intrude upon. Anyone who can survive so long in the dark, alone and unaided, must be terribly dangerous, and very likely mad
		<br><br>
		He has been here apparently longer than anyone else, and his knowledge of the deep places is regarded as unurpassed.
