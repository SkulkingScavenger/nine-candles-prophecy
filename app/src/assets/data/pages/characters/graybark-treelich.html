		Betrayer of trees and the guardian of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/zaramon">Zaramon</a>, Graybark Treelich has grown dark and twisted through his long years of exile. In his madness he seeks to grow beyond the bounds of the oubliette itself and break through to the true sun that lies beyond

		For thousands of years, Graybark Treelich has grown in the darkness, feasting on mountains of corpses his seeking roots have found in the dark pockets of The Oubliette, absorbing the human essence. But its leaves still craved the sun. And so it burned the forest, releasing the sunlight stored in its dead brothers.
		<br>
		The forest would not last forever, and so Graybark gathered together the men of ravensburg and invited them to eat of its dark fruit and promising to return them to the sun. At his orders, they built for the tree a vast furnace, and scattered throughout the Oubliette to gather fuel. One day, if they are dutiful, the Great Oak will grow so tall that it will break through to the sun, and rise out of the depths. Its roots twist and turn in the darkness, forcing themselves through brick and stone in search of vile sustenance, long hidden from the ravening darkness of the oubliette.
