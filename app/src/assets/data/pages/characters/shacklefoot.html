		Shacklefoot is an old and weary navigator, whose exploits and adventures have become legendary. However, lately his long centuries of sin have begun to weigh upon him
		<br><br>
		During a long stay in Lanternvale, hiding under an enchantment while he recovered from a deathly wound, he found a part of his humanity return to him thanks to his friendship with one of the villagers. Although eventually his corruption forced him to return to the oubliette, for fear that the enchantment would fail, he has found himself unable to forget the memory of living warmth, which he had long thought buried
		<br><br>
		Too late, Shacklefoot has come to repent of the Shademark. Recognizing the desperation of his condition, Shacklefoot went in secret to beg a boon of the terrible <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/wardens/grimnas">lord of Korhazar</a>. Although Lord Grimnas agreed to have pity upon the navigator, a price must first be paid...
		<br><br>
		Since that day he has worked feverishly and secretly in pursuit of that single goal
