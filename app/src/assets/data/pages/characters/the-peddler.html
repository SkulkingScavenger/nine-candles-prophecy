		The Peddler is a well known figure in the depths, driving his cart on an endless route throughout the deep places.<br> 
		His approach is easily recognized by the plodding claws of his horses, the sickly-pale glow of his jangling coach-lamps and the humming of his familiar, jaunty tunes.
		<br><br> 
		Although there is something about him that makes one uncomfortable on first meeting, those who have spent long in the oubliette, far from the forsaken villages, are grateful for his work. One can trade for essentials at a remote outpost, or barter at a candlerest with fellow travelers, but one never knows what they might have in stock, if anything.<br>
		The Peddler, on the other hand, always seems to have just what you need and all manner of wonders besides.
		<br><br>
		He is well stocked on all the essentials: If you should need an enchanted sword to vanquish the Krakanak or a sapphire flute to lure the Snarlok away from his gnawing, a satchet of cursed crimson firecrackers or just a second-hand mail coat, The Peddler can provide.<br>
		But for his favorite customers, he deals in more exotic goods. There is a market, it seems, for voices, for hearts, for fond memories and for bright futures (If you happen to have one of <i>these</i> and are willing to part with it, he will pay most handsomely!) and the like.
		<br><br>
		Very little is known of him.<br> 
		His name and his past are a mystery. He may be a demon, monster or shademarked fiend... or perhaps something else entirely.<br> He is never seen apart from his cart, nor does he ever stop at the villages.
		<br>
		Indeed, there is doubt that he is even a single person. The oubliette is a wide place and yet one seems to run into him everywhere. It's not as if anyone would really know the difference. Though talkative, he is never familiar, and of course no one has ever seen his face.
		<br> 
		Perhaps he is simply a fevered delusion of a blighted mind...
		<br><br>
		But while he does not speak of himself, he is an excellent source of news and seems to know everything that goes on in the oubliette: The latest gossip from the Court of Malivol and the scheming of the New Tharas guildlords, the state of the Hekkathan economy and what the Jakilaunts are saying about each other in their dens...<br> 
		However, if you're looking for a specific piece of information, he will charge a fee, which may be quite hefty in some cases. And for the deeper secrets, he will insist on being paid in kind rather than currency
		<br><br>
		One final thing it is important to note: One must never attempt to cheat The Peddler.<br>
		Many crafty candlebearers, confident in their superior wits, have tried (oh how they have tried...) and quite a few were certain they had got the better of the old scarecrow.<br>
		These always learn, to their terror and dismay, that one always ends up paying the peddlers price, one way or another
