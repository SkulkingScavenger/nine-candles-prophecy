A viscous, black, flammable substance that, when burned, gives off a fierce red light and surprising heat. Though the illumination it gives off is disappointingly dim, the dregs themselves never seem to be consumed (they will, however, burn through almost any container, in time) which confers a certain utility where candles are scarce.

It is vaguely sinister. Many report that it ripples even when still, that it whispers faintly in dead silence, that tortured figures can be seen in its flame. It seems safe enough to cook with though (as a heat source; dregs are not ordinarily eaten, on account of their high value, and a perhaps justified fear of other effects).
