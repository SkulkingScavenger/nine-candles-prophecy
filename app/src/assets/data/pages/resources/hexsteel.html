The cursed black metal of the wardens: wrought in hellfire and quenched in living blood, infused inside and out with burning sigils.

Hexsteel is supernaturally resilient, far stronger than steel, though also heavier. It is impervious to any form of mundane heat and most of the time it keeps oddly cold, as if siphoning the warmth from the area around it. It is also one of the few substances that shades cannot pass through

Hexsteel tools are used commonly in witchcraft: it is one of the only materials that can safely contain burning dregs, among other things, and hexsteel chains and anchors are used extensively in necromancy. Theoretically, one could exploit its thermal properties to preserve food, but due mainly to human squeamishness towards cursed artifacts, the practice remains limited to eccentric gremlins.

It is, of course, ruinously expensive. The secret of its forging is carefully guarded, and it's wielders (wardens and their servants, generally) are seldom slain. Nevertheless, second-hand hexsteel goods (particularly weapons) can often be purchased in <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/new-tharas">New Tharas</a>, or from <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/the-peddler">The Peddler</a> and his ilk.
