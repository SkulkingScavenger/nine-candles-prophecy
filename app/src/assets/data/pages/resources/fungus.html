An ubiquitous substance, various species of fungus are found in the oubliette, both wild and cultivated.  In more humid regions, it is more plentiful than darkroot and grows much faster. Many are edible, though somewhat bland, and the stalks of the larger species can be cut and dried to make building materials in a pinch, though the result is not particularly strong and susceptible to rot.

While there are a bewildering variety of molds, mushrooms lichens and other growths here, to the population at large (excluding healers, apothecaries, alchemists and farmers), these are really only interesting for their edibility or lack thereof. Two classes are outstanding:
<br><br>
Firstly, the giant mushrooms that grow in huge forests, where the climate is damp and organic material is available in large quantities. The most common species is edible, if not palatable. 
<br><br>
Secondly, the vibrantly glowing mushrooms, the most brilliant of which can be found in the legendary forest of lights. Though individual chunks of mushroom flesh soon lose their phosphorescence, smaller  growths can be transplanted whole to serve as living candles, which are highly prized both for their exotic beauty and utility as a clean and long-lasting light-source.
