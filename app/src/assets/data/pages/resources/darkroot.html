The dark, twisted roots that grow through the caves of the oubliette is the foundation of most of the oubliette's strange ecology.
<br>
Darkroot grows in many shapes and kinds, sometimes occurring as an undergrowth of scraggly vines, sometimes in great forests that rise out of the cavern floor, other times forming impassable, thorny thickets that choke entire tunnels. There are rumors that deep in the oubliette the darkroot grows so vast and malevolent that the vines grow teeth and move of their own accord, devouring anything that comes too close
<br>
When they grow thin and long, draping from cavern roofs like vines or growing up from the ground like leafless saplings, they are pliable, almost elastic, and easily woven. Thicker boles can be processed into boards which, once dried, make for sturdy, rot-resistant boards.

Darkroot logs burn readily, particularly when fresh, for the sap is highly flammable and burns with a hot, ruddy flame. Indeed, if the sap is drained and bottled (a somewhat involved process) it can be used in lanterns or torches for a light-source more portable (and often better smelling) than candles.
When dried, the logs glow with with a more ordinary yellower light, similar to Surface Wood.
