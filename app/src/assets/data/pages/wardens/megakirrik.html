<div class="poem">
	there's nothing you can do now<br>
	to damage or to mend<br>
	Although it's not completed, <br>
	your journey's at an end<br>
	<br>
	So rest, my old companion,<br>
	lay down your heavy load<br>
	And close the eyes so weary<br>
	that glimpsed me on the road<br>
	<br>
	For though you entertained me,<br>
	My most elusive prey,<br>
	it never was in question<br>
	which of us would win the day<br>
	<br>
	Our time is growing short now<br>
	I feel you going cold<br>
	A tender last goodbye for<br>
	my fiery foe of old<br>
	<br>
	But I have just one question<br>
	for you, here at the last<br>
	Some things are only clear when<br>
	all else is in the past<br>
	<br>
	Does anything have meaning<br>
	Now all's about to fade?<br>
	those high ideals and noble dreams<br>
	still sparkle in the shade?<br>
	<br>
	No friends are coming with you<br>
	forgotten and alone<br>
	for debts unpaid and deeds undone<br>
	you never shall atone<br>
	<br>
	The righteous works you strived for<br>
	How many came to pass?<br>
	The tiny rays of sunshine...<br>
	to what do they amass?<br>
	<br>
	You tried to make a difference<br>
	and briefly you glowed bright:<br>
	a fleeting spark of fire <br>
	in an everlasting night<br>
	<br>
	the principles that led you<br>
	were planted in your head<br>
	by fools who came before you<br>
	and whither have they led?<br>
	<br>
	Your kindness, oft misguided,<br>
	brought misery and pain<br>
	how much was self-deception?<br>
	how much was done in vain?<br>
	<br>
	Do little sins disturb you?<br>
	Are you worse than you believed?<br>
	or does everything seem pointless<br>
	and now you're just relieved?<br>
	<br>
	You used to be so violent<br>
	so loud and self-assured<br>
	But now you've gone all quiet<br>
	You've hardly said a word<br>
	<br>
	Perhaps you've come to realize<br>
	the folly of your plan<br>
	<br>
	For this world belongs to monsters...<br>
