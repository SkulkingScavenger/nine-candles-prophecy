	The light of the crimson sun burns in the heart of the oubliette, breathing stolen life into a world that was condemned to die in darkness.<br><br>
	The sigils are the arteries through which the fires flow, the living words by whose voices the thought of the crimson architects takes form.<br> 
	Wrought by the archwardens upon the carapace of sacrificed angels, these runes bear a terrible power. Whatever names or commands they invoke carry the power and authority the sun below.<br>
	To learn their names is perilous. To scribe them is to weave a chain of fire by which one shall ever more be bound.<br><br>
	For a name is an anchor to the earth, and no hand may grasp flame without sacrifice
