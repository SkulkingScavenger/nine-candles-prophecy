	The light that exists within the forsaken is pale and dim, a reflection of a fire has been long lost, as the moon reflects the sun.<br><br>
	However, there once dwelt in the oubliette creatures of True Flame. Their incandescence remains within their smoldering cores, coveted by wardens and gremlins alike.<br>
	Incandescent cores are potently, dangerously magical. Their uses are many, their power virtually inexhaustible.<br><br>
	For Gremlins, they mean something still more: a righting of old wrongs, a return to a past glory, to a time when they rode the high winds on sable wings<br>
