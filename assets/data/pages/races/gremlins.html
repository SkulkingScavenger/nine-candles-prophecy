			Accursed and betrayed, the ghoulish creatures known as Gremlins lurk in the depths of the oubliette, silently prowling its dark paths and byways in search of prey. Though these skulking fiends were never meant to survive their exile, they have learned to thrive, to the sorrow of humans and wardens alike.
			<br><br>
			The Gremlins are diabolically crafty and as cold and ruthless as the oubliette itself. They are a constant menace to expeditions and have even been known to launch coordinated attacks on fortified settlements should the opportunity present itself. Those unfortunate enough to fall into their clutches may expect no pity from these vile scavengers, and their ravenous hunger for flesh admits of neither scrupulosity nor delicacy.
			<br><br>
			Though reviled for their abhorrent ways, gremlins are willing to trade for what they cannot take by cunning. Those desperate or callous enough to treat with them may find in them a vast knowledge of dark and secret things, for the gremlins are ancient and though rarely glimpsed or heard, they are always watching. They are also legendary for their smithcraft, for the gremlins are experts in the secrets of steel and fire.

			Creatures of rot, blight and bone, gremlins are appalling to behold and carry a faint carrion stench. They are typically of roughly humanoid form, though stooped and ratlike, able to scurry on all fours to clamber up walls and dive through narrow passages in the caves. <br>
			An amalgam of the worst features of rat, jackal and vulture, they are generally covered with black, rotting fur or feathers, with pale, rubbery tails and white, mask-like faces. Their claws are bony and viciously clawed
			<br><br>
			The features of individuals varies, sometimes dramatically, and those who manage to satiate their craving for light may undergo monstrous transformations, reverting closer to their primal state. <br>

			In the first days of darkness, the wardens despaired, for in all their lands there was neither light nor hope and all that they had ever cared for was dying. Then one looked to the stars that burned in sunless skies, a dark possibility stirred. In desperation they prepared the great sacrifice.
			<br><br>
			Tearing at the quivering flesh of the entombed god, the Archwardens filled it with all their vengeance and lust for light and fashioned it into creatures of primal hunger. And Krikirrik gave them black wings with which to ascend into the heavens.
			<br> 
			The corpse-born did as they were born to do, and hunted the children of Esha, devouring their incandescence with reckless greed.
			<br>
			Burning with stolen flame and swollen huge and fell upon the blood of angels, the corpse-born grew powerful beyond all control. The moths hid in the earth and, deprived of their prey, the corpseborn turned greedy eyes upon the dominions.
			<br><br>
			Their purpose having been fulfilled, The wardens, partially for remorse at their sins against the moths and partly for fear that the corpseborn would grow beyond their control, assembled the corpseborn in bad faith and stripped them of their living flame. This fire they corrupted and fashioned into the sun below. As for the corpse-born, they were to be reduced to lifeless ashen husks.
			<br><br>
			In this the wardens miscalculated, for the Corpseborn had been injured, not destroyed.
			<br><br>
			From darkness and hunger they were born, and though their light and wings had been stolen, that hunger remained.
			<br> 
			Nor were the wardens able to eliminate all the survivors, for they were at home in the darkness that the wardens feared. The survivors fled into the deep old places beyond the dominions, feeding upon death and blight and multiplying in darkness.
			<br> <br>
			And the gremlins never forgot or forgave the betrayal of the wardens, knowing well that they had been marked for extinction with the birth of the crimson sun.
			<br>
			From those dark places they have come out ever since to devour the light wherever it may be found.
