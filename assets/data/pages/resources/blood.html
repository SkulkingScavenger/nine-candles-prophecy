The hidden fire, the warmth of the living... It lies in the blood. Blood is a chain, blood is an anchor. By blood we inherit and by blood are we bound. 
<br><br>
Human blood is a basic ingredient for many esoteric rituals, and is one of the substances in which the burning sigils can be scribed. Many monsters feed on the luminosity therein, and some will trade for it if that is easier than force.
<br>
While theoretically an infinitely renewable resource, collection and storage pose logistical difficulties
<br><br>
Not all blood is of the same kind or quality, and for stronger spells, not just any blood will do. Some call for the blood of a particular sort of person, or that has been spilled in a particular way. And while there is a niche market for stale blood, it is generally wanted fresh, ideally before it loses its original warmth.

The blood of other creatures have their own properties, but that of humans tends to dominate underworld markets, being both in reliably high demand and abundant supply.
