Starbone, or treasonsteel as it is enigmatically called by gremlin smiths, is a luminous, almost glass-like metal prized chiefly by the gremlins. It is incredibly light for its strength, which is greater than steel, and likely has other uses
<br><br>
It is extracted by a secret process from the strange metallic substance found in Skyfall deposits. Gremlins are oddly hesitant to trade it to outsiders (which is to say, their prices are absolutely unreasonable), and guard the knowledge of its working jealously. Most starbone items in human possession are weapons acquired as loot from dead gremlins.

It is said that a sorrow worm can only be slain by a weapon of Starbone, and certainly, neither Seshek nor Sorrow Worms have any friendship for those who carry this material.
