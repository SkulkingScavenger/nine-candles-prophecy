		Most creatures have grown pale and withered within the oubliette, far, far away from the sun. But those creatures of subterranean darkness, well used to burrowing blindly in deep places, have on the contrary grown large and cunning, swollen with might.<br> 
		Such creatures are the great spiders of the oubliette, who thrive within its stygian passages. 
		<br><br>
		The oubliette is full of caves and chasms that have become infested with such eight-legged beasts, who leave as their unmistakable mark of habitation the gossamer snares that hang like subtle drapery as comfortably among the glistening stalactites of the caves as within the narrow corridors of mouldering ruins. 
		<br><br>
		The larger species can be quite dangerous, and even when care is taken not to stumble into the snares it is dangerous to linger nearby. The great webs built to hold a blind <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/palewalkers">palewalker</a> in its death throes are, in many cases, easily revealed by torchlight, but the silent steps of the arachnids as they creep out from overhangs and hidden tunnels may well take one by surprise in the claustrophobic and poorly illuminated regions in which they are wont to  nest. Of course, one must never assume anything as certain spiders can be quite cunning in how they lay their traps. The notorious <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/murkweavers">murkweavers</a> are known to weave their webs of shadows and and smoke that devour the light. Still more insidious and subtle are those of the dread <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/finger-spiders">finger-spiders</a> whose strangling silk, so the legends tell, is woven of whispered lies, flattery and empty promises. 
		<br><br>
		Moreover, many of the Oubliette's giant spider species are social creatures, forming colonies that can, provided a sufficient source of prey, grow alarmingly extensive. When the colony is roused by danger or the scent of prey, like a pack of arachnid wolves they may surround and destroy enemies far larger than any individual member. 
		<br><br>
		However, if Spider Hollows present a danger, they are also a valuable source of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/silk">rare silks</a>. clever travelers who know the trick of it will often set their camps not far from a spider hollow, carefully harvesting webs with long poles across from a barrier of flame or some other substance detested by the inmates, and then retreat without altogether discouraging the weavers from their work, so that in the course of repeated comings and goings they might harvest the same patches repeatedly upon their route.
