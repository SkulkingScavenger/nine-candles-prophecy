		Most creatures have grown pale and withered within the oubliette, far from the nourishing light of the true sun. But not all.<br> 
		Those creatures born of subterranean darkness, well used to burrowing blindly in deep places, have on the contrary grown large and cunning, swollen with might.<br> 
		Such are the great spiders of the oubliette, who thrive within its stygian passages. 
		<br><br>
		Many of the caves and chasms of the oubliette have become infested with such eight-legged beasts, who leave as their unmistakable mark of habitation those insidious gossamer snares, hanging like subtle drapery among the glistening stalactites and mouldering ruins. 
		<br><br>
		The webs of the larger species can be quite dangerous to humans, as can the spiders themselves. The sturdy nets built to hold a blind <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/palewalkers">palewalker</a> in its death throes are, in many cases, easily revealed by torchlight, but the silent steps of the arachnids as they creep out from overhangs and hidden tunnels may well take one by surprise in the claustrophobic and poorly illuminated regions in which they are wont to  nest. And certain spiders can be quite cunning in how they lay their traps. The notorious <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/murkweavers">murkweavers</a> are known to weave light-devouring webs of shadows and and smoke, but still more insidious and subtle are those of the dread <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/finger-spiders">finger-spiders</a> whose strangling silk, so the legends tell, is woven of whispered lies, flattery and empty promises. 
		<br><br>
		Moreover, many of the Oubliette's giant spider species are social creatures. Provided a sufficient source of prey, their colonies may grow alarmingly extensive. When these are roused by danger or the scent of prey, like a pack of arachnid wolves they may surround and destroy enemies far larger than any individual member. 
		<br><br>
		However, if Spider Hollows present a danger, they are also a valuable source of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/silk">rare silks</a>. Clever travelers who know the trick of it will often set their camps not far from a spider hollow. The webs can be safely harvested with long poles, ideally across from a barrier of flame or some other substance detested by the inmates, and after that it is only a matter of retreating with the stolen goods before the owners take offense. It is a bit slow, but it is relatively safe and if you're out in the caves anyway, you can make good money doing it.
