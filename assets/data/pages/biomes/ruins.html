		Crumbling structures broken off from the hold of the dominions, adrift in the darkness, or perhaps the remains of a forsaken village. 
		<br>
		the accumulated debris of countless civilizations lie entombed within the caverns of the oubliette, rotting forever in darkness
		<br>
		For here, the shadows of the past have a way of lingering well after it has been forgotten. Indeed the oubliette is in many ways a repository for all that has been forgotten and discarded.
		<br><br>
		These old structures... castles, dungeons, temples and cities... form important landmarks for those who dwell in the darkness below. They are a source of shelter and danger, their depths filled with lost and hidden things for those with courage or stupidity to descend
		<br><br>
		But one must be careful: such places are not always as abandoned as they seem, and make for attractive lairs for many creatures. navigators and gremlins alike find old fortifications a convenient place to establish hideouts. In many cases, the original tenants still cling to the halls they once walked on legs of flesh. 
		<br>
		And in old dark places, there are things which have festered and grown ever more malignant with the passage of time, lurking in the depths of rotting dungeons and crypts for those fool enough to disturb them.
