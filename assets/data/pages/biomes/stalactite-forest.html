	Stalactites and Stalagmites are common features in almost all caves, but the oubliette is home to some regions deserving special mention for the size and number of these structures. There are chasms where the stone towers grow so wide that <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/frieberg">entire villages</a> can be built into the sides of them. <br>
	Such speleothemic forests are a favored haunt of giant spiders and other arboreal beasts. For this reason, they are avoided by other, less maneuverable creatures. 
	<br><br>
	As these areas can be quite expansive, it is generally wise to plan ahead and bring plenty of rope and sturdy climbing spikes or pick.

	While the term applies perfectly well to what amounts to subterranean mountain ranges of the ordinary variety, it is common for these stalagmite archipelagos to acquire a deal of character of their own. Some may be home to vast colonies of spiders whose silk bridges provide easy transit, provided something can be worked out with the inhabitants. Others may play host to a clan of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/blackwings">giant bats</a>, in which case you had better keep an ear out for the flapping of hungry wings<br>
	In some cases the great stone "trees" may indeed bear fruit, such as the enchanted cavern of jewels, in which case you are lucky. In others, the "craggy teeth" may prove distressingly literal, as is the case of the flesh-eating caves, in which case you are not.
