		Formed by the impact of the mysterious <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/mechanics/weather#skyfall">falling objects</a> sometimes flung down from the heavens, these craters are generally found at the bottom of very deep holes piercing through several layers of cavern, tunnel and dungeon (incidentally, a very useful kind of shortcut, if you have enough rope for it and aren't bothered by heights).

		Whatever it is that creates the craters, it is scarcely recognizable at the end of its journey. Particularly not if a gremlin scavenging party has been at it first, and generally they always are. The creatures seem to have a sixth sense for finding the things...

		There are legends that say that great treasures lie at the center of a skyfall crater, and perhaps if the descent should pass through a treasure vault or goldmine it might be true. Not many are willing or able to dig through so much piled debris to find out, although the outer layers are generally worth skimming. You might find anything

		More experienced and daring denizens of the deep generally take a greater interest in the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/starbone">oddly luminous ore</a> that occurs exclusively in such craters. Even if you don't have the stomach to trade with gremlins, you can probably find someone who does, and their smiths are always willing to pay handsomely for it
