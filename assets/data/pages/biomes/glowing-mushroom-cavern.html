		The soft light of a glowing cavern is a welcome sight to any weary traveler
		<br><br>
		The fabled <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/forest-of-lights">Forest of Lights</a> is an obvious example, but most are not so ostentatious.

		The most common species of glowing mushroom gives off only a simple blue-white light.
		<br><br>
		These caves are much rarer than ordinary mushroom forests (perhaps 15% of mushroom forests are luminous) and generally do not overlap, as the giant mushrooms tend to squeeze out their smaller, more delicate cousins.
