		Though their names have been forgotten by men, the old gods still rule over the dark places of the oubliette.<br>
		Ancient guardians of the Nine Kingdoms, they are bound to the lands and creatures under their care, and as their realms have withered and twisted, so have they. 
		<br><br>
		They lurk in dark corners and in deep places, watching over their festering domains, or wander amid the black winds that blow from the depths. And they are always waiting deep beneath the veil of sleep, in the horrible crimson realm of nightmare and fever-dream that appears wherever the walls of reality have been peeled away. 
		<br><br>
		In times past they have shown benevolence to those who gave proper respect and observed the ancient laws. But despair and unconsummated vengeance, left to fester over long millenniums of darkness and isolation, have given rise at length to madness and obsession, and they have little love left for mankind.
		<br> 
		Despite the danger, there are still those who practice the old ways, largely forgotten among the forsaken, and where it is not possible to avoid them it may be wise to appease them.
		<br><br>
		The lesser ones are capricious creatures, sometimes giving aid, sometimes working mischief, although as the dominions fade they have grown darker and more sinister<br>
		The greater ones are terrible beings, fearful to treat with yet still willing in some cases to give aid to mortals... for a price of course. Others, given over to hatred or consumed by madness, prowl the darkness as terrible forces of implacable destruction and subversion, and woe to those who meet them on the road...
		<br><br>
		In all cases, their concern for the feeding of the crimson sun has made them bloodthirsty. Fearful sacrifices have been made, and yet still more must be offered in the days to come

		Form is shifting, subject to errors in perception and disemulation. The unseen truth is fixed, bound by burning oaths and secret names. At the core of every warden is an animating principle.<br>
		Though each warden has unique duties and powers, this core serves as a rough form of classification

		<b>Volition</b><br>
		The force that manifests, by which thoughts are made real
