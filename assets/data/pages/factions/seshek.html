		Believed by many to have gone extinct long ago, a handful of these ancient creatures yet remain to watch over the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/biomes/candlerest">Candlerests</a>: beacons of soothing light where the wandering dead may find rest, as may the living who know of their secret locations. 
		<br><br>
		The Seshek are inoffensive for the most part, desiring only to continue their work in peace. But they are not defenseless. Indeed, they are the guardians of an ancient and formidable magic, which is believed to be greater even than that of the wardens, though they have seldom had recourse to it in its full might.
		<br><br>
		As keepers of memories and friends of the dreamlords, the Seshek possess a profound insight into the souls of other creatures. Such empathy is a curse, for like their lost benefactors, they take on the suffering of others as their own

		The features of the Gravekeepers are rarely seen, on account of their heavy, cowled robes of office. Beneath these, their features are pale and chitinous. Their faces are eyeless, and somewhat resembling large insects. Individuals are easily identified by prominent ornamental crests.<br>
		They are taller than humans, but skeletally slight and the few who remain are quite old and bent with age and care.<br>
		Even under their robes, Gravekeepers are easily recognized by their pale lanterns

		The Remaining Gravekeepers seldom travel far from their candlerests, where they are needed, and correspondence is not easy on account of their secrecy. News does travel between them, slowly. 
	<!-- 	<br>
		Primordial Seshek Society is not a matter of secrecy, but the pain of loss has never faded, and they seldom speak of it. They were numerous in those days, living in great, spired cities on the shores of the silver lake. Then, as now, they served as guides for wandering spirits, crafting the candles that illuminated the ancient oubliette. They often wandered in the realm of dream and memory, gathering the stories of the dead.  -->

	<div class="subsection-body">
		In ancient times the Seshek dwelt upon the shores of the Silver lake alongside the Silver worms, who they revered as the keepers of dreams, and whose friendship they cherished. At that time they were named candlemakers, for they kept lit the lanterns by which the dead may find their way to the silver lake. The oubliette was not then a black pit, but a place of silver mist and clear, sweet waters, illuminated by the pale candles of the seshek and the soft bittersweet music of the worms. A place of healing and repose, without sorrow or fear. 
		<br><br>
		The Seshek had as yet no reason to mistrust any, and saw the sovereigns as brethren, and when Esha, the queen of the Sorrow worms was wed to Mathranoath, there was only gladness among the candlemakers. 
		<br>
		However, their guileless trust in the sovereigns led to their ruin, for when Aoth had slain his brother and wished to hide what he had done, he came first to the seshek in their hidden realm deep below the dominions of light, and bid them safeguard the corpse against any who would defile it. 
		<br><br>
		And so the Seshek, doubting nothing of what he said and eager to do honor for the husband of Esha their queen, built upon a misty island in the silver lake the Great Tomb, and in so doing they brought upon themselves the same poison that had destroyed the dominions. The blight that Aoth had planted in the deathless sovereign seeped out as a foul corruption and the sorrow worms fled as the waters blackened. The lost souls that once found rest on the silver shores were tainted with Mathranoath's inchoate rage, his helpless screams echoing through their dreams and driving them to madness. 
		<br>
		The Seshek remained for a time, hoping to contain the corruption, and to this end they crafted the Great Nails to bind his spirit and the titan chains by which the Great Tomb was sealed.
		<br><br>
		However, in time the Wardens came seeking the carcass, desperate to preserve their lands. They ignored the pleas of the Seshek and opened the crypt. There they fashioned the vile gremlins, the devourers of the dead, who have plagued the oubliette ever since. 
		<br>
		The Seshek fled from the accursed lake filled with sorrow and pursued by the gremlins, and yet they did not abandon their duties. Scattered among the dominions they gathered up what lost souls they could find and built in darkness the candle-rests, there to bury the dead that they may wander no more, safe from the depredations of the gremlins who would devour them, or the wardens who would shackle them to the crimson sun.
