		Of all the Gremlin Raiders to plague the southern caves, few are as feared or as hated as Rotfang the Cruel.
		<br><br>
		Hailing originally from the marshes of North Tharas, Rotfang earned a horrific reputation in Hearthfire and New Tharas, and notoriety among the gremlin clans for her brutal marauding. 
		<br><br>
		In the eyes of her own kind, her substantial prowess as a raider is overshadowed by her reputation as a peerless blacksmith, one of the few in all the dominions to unlock the secrets of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/hexsteel">hexsteel</a>.
		<br><br>
		However, for all her skill and cunning, she was denied the incandescence she craved above all else, and at length her greed drove her to drastic measures.
		<br><br>
		Her subsequent exile has been filled with many crazy adventures

	<div class="subsection-body">
		Rotfang was formerly a Raidmaster of the Kirrikash, a clan based in the bogs of Northern Tharas not far from Hearthfire. She basically ran the place and should have been chieftain after Palescar.
		<br><br>
		Thanks to <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/gray-eyes">some meddling shaman</a> though, the title and, far more importantly, the clan's <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/artifacts/incandescent-cores">Worm Hearts</a> passed to his bootlicking third-in-command instead. Knowing he had no chance of holding on to his winnings alone, Flayskin graciously returned the favor and sold himself to <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/throatbiter">Gray Eyes' puppet ruler</a>.
		<br> 
		Rotfang wouldn't have cared, being more than happy to hunt alone and with zero intention of sharing a dime with some Magakashi upstart, but then Flayskin decided to invite his new friends along on a worm hunt...
		<br><br>
		...For <i>Rotfang's</i> <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/sorrow-worms">worm</a>.
		<br><br>
		She found it. She tracked it. She arguably didn't really need their help and definitely didn't ask for it, and even if she did, Throatbiter could go jump down a chasm.
		<br>
		Some unfortunate things were said and after the ensuing squabble Flayskin, and a few other people Throatbiter apparently really liked, were dead in a ditch. But hey, everybody loses their temper from time to time, and things could have blown over if Rotfang would just <i>fork over the core</i>...
		<br><br>
		Obviously THAT didn't happen, and, being outnumbered and having alienated most of her former clan, Rotfang decided to strike off alone.

		Apparently he really cared about that worm...
		<br><br>
		Or, maybe he was related to one of the thousands of people she's eaten over the years. It's hard to keep track, especially now she's got throatbiters' bounty-hunters to watch for. Everybody wants Rotfang it seems like, and to be fair, its hard not to hate someone who's so much better than you at literally everything. 
		<br><br>
		However, <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/alric">Sir Alric</a> has proved a more troublesome adversary than her lesser haters, returning again and again to get in the way while she's trying to work, and somehow hasn't died yet.
		<br><br>
		In fact, she's almost starting to think he might be an actual threat...

		<h3 class="subsection-title">Quest for the Incandescent Cores</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="subsection-body">
		Since the theft of her first incandescent core, long denied her, Rotfang's lust for incandescence has only grown
		<br><br>
		She has killed many Sorrow Worms since, tracking them back to their hidden temples, shattering their enchantments with the help of sinister allies, cutting down their guardians and butchering them in their lairs
		<br><br>
		She has also cannibalized a few other incandescent gremlins, overconfident huntsmasters who thought to collect on Throatbiter's bounty and claim her cores for themselves. 
		<br><br>
		But the greatest prize of all she discovered deep in the hidden depths of Sherab: a living legend long thought extinct, a lost creature of True Flame.
		<br>
		It didn't go down easy, but it was well worth the trouble
		<br><br>
		For at length, her blood burning with stolen flame, she has seen the beginnings of a terrible and glorious transformation

	<div class="subsection-body">
		Rotfang is stuck in a toxic relationship with a certain <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/kirith">skinless failure</a>, who sold himself into slavery to <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/wardens/shiragazira">the most insane and sadistic warden alive</a> for basically no reason like an absolute chump. 
		<br><br>
		His constant whining and breathtaking incompetence are barely offset by his insane luck and a couple useful spells. His retarded gimmicks make all their fights take five times longer than they should if he would just learn to parry like literally every other knight on the planet.
		<br><br>
		She doesn't really care what a couple inbred hearthfire peasants think of him either. Intimidating villagers is the easiest thing in the world and they believe everything they hear without question. Having a reputation as a terrifying soul-reaper is NOT a substitute for an actual bodycount, and if he'd ever stop dinking around in his laboratory and massacre a populace he'd know that.
