#INFOBOX_END
	The current gremlin Warlord and a notorious huntsmaster.
	<br><br> 
	Formerly chieftain of the Magakash clan, in a controversial move, he proclaimed himself Warlord after defeating his predecessor, Ear-taker, in ritual combat.<br>
	This has earned him the ire of the Council of Shamans and alienated many clans, but his claim is upheld by those who felt Ear-taker had ended the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/history/gremlin-war-1545">war</a> against <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/grayhaven">Grayhaven</a> prematurely
	<br><br>
#INTRO_END
	Throatbiter is a follower of the rogue shaman <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/gray-eyes">Gray-eyes</a>, who wishes to unite the clans against the humans. Grey-eyes tells Throatbiter that he has been chosen by the Crimson Sun to unite the clans and plunder grayhaven.
	<br>
	As intended, this prophecy has been somewhat self-fulfilling: Throatbiter successfully defeated Ear-taker and has machinated tirelessly to sway the other clans to join him in a second Grayhaven War. However, he has met heavy resistance.
	<br><br>
	The gremlin clans are jealous of their independence and take a dim view towards Throatbiter's suggestion that the title of warlord is somehow hereditary and his seeming attempts to turn a temporary alliance into a more durable organization. In addition, many see throatbiter as merely a tool of Gray-eyes, for furthering his petty vendetta against the grayhaveners. Moreover, the gremlin Shamans have vigorously condemned Throatbiter for murdering their anointed and debasing his sacred mission into a reckless adventure of self-aggrandizement. 
	<br><br>
	In the face of such misgivings, Throatbiter's personal reputation as a peerless huntsmaster and the promise of vast lootings should he succeed, are the main things holding his followers to him.<br> 
	Though Ear-taker had been universally respected, his decision to end the gloriously successful campaign of 1545 without even attempting to besiege the city baffled many, and throatbiter's challenge to single combat was backed by many disappointed raiders
