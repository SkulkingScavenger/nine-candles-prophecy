		A mysterious knight who arrived in Hearthfire, fleeing a mysterious enemy who could never be slain but who is always watching. Perhaps one day he will find the redemption he seeks...
		<br><br>
		Sir Alric is an implacable enemy, grim and remorseless. It is said he will take on any quest, with no regard for his own life. Blighted and cursed, he wars eternally in the darkness without any apparent purpose.
		<br><br>
		Only very recently has he grudgingly taken on a companion, a youthful knight who vowed to accompany him on his endless war after Alric saved his life from the fiendish <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/the-shigarga">Shigarga</a> while he wandered hopelessly lost in the marshes of Tharas.
		<br><br>
		And after decades of wandering, Sir Alric has, after a chance encounter in the bleak wastelands to the west of Hearthfire, found his purpose in life: to avenge the deaths of his companions, his family, and so many others who have suffered at the hands of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/rotfang">Rotfang the Cruel</a>
