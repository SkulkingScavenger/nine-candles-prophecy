		Fishbones is an experienced navigator, well respected among those who wander in darkness. He has borne the shademark for many cycles, fallen far and forgotten much, and yet he has learned a great deal that should perhaps have remained secret.
		<br><br>
		Plagued by nightmares after a fateful descent into the Red World, he has become addicted to the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/laudanum">silver laudanum</a>. To obtain access to the coveted substance, he entered the service of the Undertakers Guild in New Tharas, temporarily as he hoped. However, tricked and manipulated, he at last was forced to relinquish his heart to the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/guildlord-hazareth">guildmaster's</a> vaults. He has ever since been condemned to a wretched thralldom.
		<br><br>
		Desperate to find release before it is too late, Fishbones has turned at last to the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/kirith">one person</a> he thinks might possibly help him without making the problem infinitely worse...<br> But frankly the odds are against him.
