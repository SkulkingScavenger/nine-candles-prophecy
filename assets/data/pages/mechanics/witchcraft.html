	The caretakers of the Nine Kingdoms are filled with authority and secret knowledge, and there was a time when the wise among mankind would sit at their feet to learn of their ways and share in their duties.

	And there remain some even now who seek them in their madness, and among the demons of the oubliette there are those who long to plant the seeds of twisted knowledge within receptive minds. The peril of such dark diplomacy is great for the malice they bear towards mankind has grown ever deeper in these long millenniums of darkness.

	The price for such dark knowledge is one's humanity, and what comes under a warden's dominion is seldom released.
