	<h1>A note on Oubliette Geography</h1>
	<p>
		This section is difficult to organize sensibly. In the course of merely describing the dominions, a misleading impression of emphasis is built. 
		“dominions” are an inherently vague concept, used mainly by wardens, and are not exclusively (or even primarily) concerned with physical space. <br><br>
		The names of the dominions or their history are a matter of musty, half-forgotten lore, unknown and uncared for outside of a small circle. Moreover, the processes of decay and dissolution which have acted on the oubliette for millennia have blurred the boundaries of these regions. As the tunnels shift, old ruins drift away and collect in odd corners far from their place of origin.
		<br><br>
		And if the dominions do not loom large in human consciousness, neither are they predominant geographically. Even ignoring the unexplored vastness of untouched darkness beyond the periphery, where the bleakworms eternally crawl, the nine dominions combined occupy probably not more than a third of the traversable space of the setting. The sprawling caverns and tunnels that fill the space between often blur together (sometimes literally) in absence of man-made milestones, but they are neither empty nor featureless. The primordial oubliette has a magic of its own, and many of the original inhabitants still live in the shadow of the dominions. 
		<br><br>
		However, due to the uselessness of maps in the oubliette (on account of The Shifting) and the ordinary difficulty of representing three-dimensional caverns and tunnels as they pile up and overlap each other, the usual method of establishing a sense of layout and proportion is unfeasible.
		The Nine Dominions are thus used here primarily as an organizational utility, as a way of conveying at least a general sense of where things are in relation to one another. It should not be imagined that the setting is cleanly parceled out into mutually exclusive territories along continuous seams, the way a modern country is.
