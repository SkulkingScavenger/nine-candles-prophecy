	A flame is born from a spark and alights upon tinder, and then upon wood. Though the logs soon burn to ash and are replaced, though the flame constantly shifts and is never the same between one moment and another, something yet remains of that first fleeting spark.
	<br>
	A Memory of Fire.
	<br><br>
	Such a thing is the soul of man. A creature of hunger and warmth, destruction and light. It flares openly for a short time, smoldering long after it has disappeared into the dark. 
	<br><br>

	Luminosity is used to speak of that elusive something that burns within humankind, that wards off fever and nightmare, that lingers even when the flesh rots to dust, that dims and smolders in exposure to the hungry darkness, whose sudden extinguishing brings about such a hideous fate. That which so many creatures crave above all else, who have none for themselves.
