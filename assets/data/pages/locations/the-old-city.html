		The burned out shell of what might once of been a grand city, nestled in a wide Raishabar cavern looking out over a wide plain. These days it is home only to <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/shades">ghosts</a>.
		<br><br>
		The name of the Old City has been forgotten, though by the extent and sophistication of its foundations, the quality of its masonry and paved roads, it must once have been of great importance. It is curious that no mention of it occurs in the annals of other villages, many of which can boast of fairly antique origins. Lanternvale, not terribly far off, must be at least as old. 
		<br><br>
		The structures themselves are badly crumbled and eroded, half-buried in ash, the towers tumbled over. Sickly thin darkroot tendrils creep out from wells and meander among the ruins
		<br><br>
		But while the winds of Raishabar have not been kind to the old city, the depths have lain undisturbed. The ground is strangely hard. It must have been difficult to dig so many wells, so straight and so smooth, and the sewer system seems to have been advanced.
