		A throne, an altar, and a pit lie together at the heart of a great cathedral. Long ago a sacrifice was made, and it's blood has stained all the dominions.<br> Long did the priests of Ahoth contain the corruption, but at last their hunger consumed them. It will consume many more.
		<br><br>
		The dominion of Ahoth is a place of swirling mist and silent gardens. The roads are empty but travelers report feeling they are being watched from the high towers and steeples.
		<br><br>
		There is little here for the living, for those who still cling to life and light. Few return who descend into the blackness within its ancient edifices, but for those who seek them out, this is seldom a concern
		<br><br>
		For this world is an altar, where all that is most precious may be spilled out upon the ungrateful dust, whose hunger calls out through time to all who long for final dissolution and a breaking of chains. <br>
		An end to desire, an end to thought, an undoing of all that has been or will be
		<br><br>
		Woe to those who find what they seek in this place...
