		A seedy tavern/inn complex nestled amid the enormous columns and buttresses of some titanic structure in the lower Korhazar Ruins, near the old catacombs. 
		<br><br>
		The beer is questionable and the cost of food is frankly extortionate. The lodgings are shamefully spare considering what one has to pay for them, and the noise from the adjacent tavern (which never really quiets down) is so obnoxious that one must wonder if there's any point trying to sleep anyway.
		<br><br>
		But as competition is scarce in those parts, the whining of the locals falls upon ears that, while certainly not deaf (something of a miracle, considering the constant ruckus in the place), belong to a gremlin of such outrageous stinginess that in discussing matters of fair pricing, one may mistakenly come to believe that they are.
		<br><br>
		Is it actually named after the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/ragshak">owner!?!?</a>
