		Tharas, the drowned kingdom
		<br><br> 
		Once it was the most beautiful of all the dominions, a land of magnificent towers like alabaster icicles and sparkling azure seas as clear as crystal, where lush forests waved on shores of ivory sand. 
		<br><br>
		Now it is a swamp of filth, its spires fallen and sunken into the mire, home to toads and rats and pale sightless fish that slip silently through the dark water. Poisonous mists befoul the air and rain down toxic blight upon the slimy stones and scraggly fungal forests
		<br><br>
		Its bogs have become notorious as a hiding place for thieves and eccentric hermits. Gremlins and monsters find themselves at home in its poisonous murk. Beasts of the ancient seas still lurk in degraded form, filled with spite and resentment for their fate
		<br><br>
		In the heart of impassable bogs of lying corpselights and strangling weeds, the slimy ramparts of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/the-sunken-tower">the Sunken Tower</a> can be seen, the ancient temple of the tharas priest-kings, now the accursed palace of their vengeful god, who devoured them for their sins long ago.<br> 
		Here the Archwarden <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/shiragazira">Shiragazira</a> holds court upon the defiled throne, receiving tribute from the monsters and demons of the swamp, the souls of the drowned and the lost, and watching, ever watching upon the borders of her lands for any sign of weakness from her rivals.
