		Korhazar the accursed, once a realm of mighty kingdoms and prosperous towns, now given over to dust and cobwebs. The crumbling ruins are no longer hospitable to the living, and those who could escape fled long ago. They left behind their treasures, and the piled corpses of their wailing dead, which have rotted together in the long centuries of darkness.
		<br><br>
		From his dread castle of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/malivol-castle">Malivol</a> amid the desolate spires, the tyrant-sorcerer <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/wardens/grimnas">Grimnas</a> exacts his cruel tribute of the living and the dead, while the inhuman lord of the Citadel of Candles sends forth his raiders to sustain the extravagance of his shining fortress. 
		<br><br>
		At the heart of the dominion lies the ruined city of Korhazar itself, illuminated by the pale candles of it's restless dead. These <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/monsters/shades">shades</a> remain bound by the curse, or blessing, that ties them to their city, to their kings who lie deathless and rotting within their <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/cathedral-of-the-seven-kings">sacred tombs</a>
