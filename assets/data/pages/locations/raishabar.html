		To the East lie the bleak and lightless wastes of Raishabar. A land of wide gray caverns full of burned out ruins, twisting ravines and the rattling of dried bones. Here the black winds blow with unchecked strength, twisting and howling through the winding tunnels, or sweep waves of ash across the desolate plains of its vastcaverns. And where the black winds blows, tireless packs of dark and spindly things run with them in an endless hunt.

		Raishabar was once home to several major civilizations, as testified by the vast and sprawling ruins that dot its landscape. A few small outposts still remain nestled in caves and chasms.
