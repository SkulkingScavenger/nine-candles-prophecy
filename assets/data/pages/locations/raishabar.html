	To the East lie the bleak and lightless wastes of Raishabar. Dry gray fields of burned out structures, twisting ravines and the rattling of dried bones.  Here the black winds blow with unchecked strength, twisting and howling through the winding chasms, or sweep across the desolate plains with flensing force, and tireless packs of dark and spindly things run with them in an endless hunt.
