		It is said that, in ancient times, the ivory spires of Varasa rose above the clouds, gleaming like starlight: the most sacred and glorious of all Tharas' cathedrals.<br> 
		There, within its highest tower, the Tharas priest-kings would congregate to hold their grand synod.<br>
		It was there that the high priests sought refuge when their city sank beneath the waves, and it was there that at last they were devoured for their sins.
