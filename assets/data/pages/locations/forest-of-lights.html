A forest of phosphorescent fungi that sprawls over a series of labyrinthine caverns.<br><br>
The light of the fungi shines like a beacon to the light-starved inhabitants of the oubliette. Despite this, few dare to make their homes near the forest, for it is home to many dangers. Hungry predators lie in wait for unwary and light-dazzled travelers. Toxic spores roll along like a fog, and in many places the solid ground of the caverns gives way suddenly to treacherous bogs of liquescent compost.

All these pale before the forest's most terrible guardians, the Lords of the Mycelial Court. These predatory creatures combine traits of plants, fungi, and animals. They tend and guard the glowing mushrooms, fertilizing them with organic remains gathered from across the oubliette. Those unfortunate enough to be captured alive face a hideous ordeal before being composted.

While such threats make the region inhospitable to settlers, there are always a few souls desperate or brave enough to dare the the Forest of Lights. Some risk life and sanity for a mere glimpse at the fantastic realm, but most are drawn by the sheer financial promise of the mushrooms themselves. Although the phosphorescent fruiting bodies lose their glow soon after harvesting, if the mycelia is carefully transplanted, a few species can be kept alive outside the forest for some time. Light is precious in the oubliette, even without heat, and these "everlasting candles" are highly sought after.
