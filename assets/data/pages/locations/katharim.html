		Buried deep in the heart of the cursed dominion of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/hekkath">Hekkath</a>, nestled among the catacombs of the royal crypts, the alabaster pillars of Katharim rise like bleached bones from a dessicate carcass.

		All things dense and indissoluble must at last sink into the oubliette. The Catacombs of Hekkath, piled high with the accumulated human debris of untold millennia, serve as a watershed of souls as they make their way to their final dissolution within the black lake.<br>
		Lost souls from across the oubliette eventually find their way here, drawn by the power of the old Hekkath priesthood that even now lies upon the tombs. However, the preserving power of the ancient seals has been subtly corrupted by Akat's diabolical sorcery, and there is no rest here any longer, for either the living or the dead.<br><br>
