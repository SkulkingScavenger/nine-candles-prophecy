	A place of sinister might, though its beacons gleam with extravagant brightness, too often those who enter do not leave.
	<br><br>
	the folk of the citadel are at the same time warlike and insular, driven by an insatiable hunger for light and dread of the darkness without. They are jealous of their light and of their secrets, and this jealousy makes them suspicious of foreigners. They seldom leave for any reason but to gather fuel for their great fires, for fat with which to make their candles.
