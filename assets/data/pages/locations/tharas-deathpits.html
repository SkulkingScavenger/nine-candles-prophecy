		In the desolate southern reaches of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/tharas">Tharas</a> there lies a horrid pit, a vast swamp of liquescent corpses, rotting together for centuries.
		<br><br>  
		This wretched bog is the unhallowed resting place of the countless hapless victims sacrificed in the name of a hideous failure. While those early failures have, if anything, only stoked <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/wardens/shiragazira">Lord Shiragazira's</a> dark ambitions, something had to be done with all those bodies... and Shiragazira was never one to waste limited resources
		<br><br>
		And so the mountains of mad, screaming flesh was carted off and dumped into the Chasms of Thrangor to form a hideous moat of mangled souls about the <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/the-southern-gateway">dark portal of the south</a>. The wretched shades entombed here exist in a fate worse even than those consumed by the crimson sun, their essence scarred and deformed from their archwarden's cruel experiments. Theirs is a slow and agonizing distillation, but time is one thing the wardens have in abundance
