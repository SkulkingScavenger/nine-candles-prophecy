		The lower reaches of the oubliette are full of strange old ruins: the temples, fortresses and cities of cycles past. But the past, like so many things here, is often reluctant to pass away. In many places old powers lie festering within those shell-like structures, slumbering through the long centuries of darkness
		<br><br>
		The dreaded Castle of Moraj is a particularly malignant example of such a place. Its sordid history has been lost to time, but those who have spent long in the meandering depths or listen to the tales of navigators know of the hungering castle that draws travelers in like quicksand... that whoever the grisly lanterns of Moraj once fix their burning eyes upon shall never be seen again

		Moraj Castle appears similar at first glance to other ruined castles scattered about the caverns of the oubliette and, indeed, there are some who believe the castle is only the visible tip of a cancerous power that has festered in the caverns west of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/tharas">Tharas</a> for centuries.

		In any event, A baleful enchantment lies upon it, exerting a sinister undertow that pulls upon the unwary that ensnares them even as they struggle against it. A traveler finds himself circling back to the same macabre grotto, as if the tunnels themselves were curving back in upon themselves, and it's hold grows stronger the longer one lingers, and woe to those who approach the castle itself.<br>
		When the curse has advanced, the castle's true nature reveals itself as the unfortunate victim is taken bodily into the otherworld: a feast for the castle's inhuman inhabitants

		There is a legend that tells of a traveler who escaped from Moraj by the blessing of its terrible lord. The traveler had fled into the cellar of the castle, where he met a hideous creature with seven eyes set in seven heads like spiders, a body like a toad and thirteen ratlike tails. Fortunately for the traveler, he had won an enchanted deck of cards from a witch upon the road before arriving at Moraj. With these he distracted the beast long enough to slip past. Beyond the beast's lair was an ivory ring. 
		<br><br>
		When the traveler met the lord of the castle in a dark hallway, he presented the ring to the master who, distraught, promised to set him free in exchange for the return of the talisman

		Another story, far less plausible but much more recent, tells of a caravan which foolishly rested in the ruins of what they believed to be an abandoned castle in spite of their navigators' warnings. Most of the party escaped mainly due to luck and shrewd haggling on the part of a gremlin mercenary traveling as a guard.
