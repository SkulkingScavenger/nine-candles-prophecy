		There is a chamber in a cathedral in the depths of Ahoth, whose doors have been sealed since before the dawn of the crimson sun.
		<br><br>
		In that circle nine thrones stand in a circle. Three lie broken and shattered on the floor
		<br><br>
		An old crone, older than ahoth itself, tends to a white fire in a brazier at the center of the room.
		<br><br>
		One day the lords will return to their thrones at the end of all cycles, and until then the fire must be kept alight
		<br><br>
		For the sake of the prophecy which was spoken from the black mirror on the day the Stairs were shattered...
		<br><br>
		For the prophecy of nine candles
