	The Horrible Harrowhist!<br> 
	Oh what a fright<br>
	You'll get when you meet him, alone in the night<br>
	His eyes are like candles, his claws like those hooks<br>
	that you use to kill fish, and they're not just for looks:<br>
<br>
	This monster eats faces.<br> 
	He likes them a lot<br>
	And the way that he likes them is while they're still hot<br>
	Now most folks are rather attached to their skin<br>
	But then so is the harrowhist, once he gets his hooks in<br>
<br>
	That might sound quite unpleasant, but really its not<br>
	For those claws have a poison that buries the thought<br>
	of all things to do with the harrowhist's feeding<br>
	You won't even notice how much you are bleeding!<br>
