<div class="poem">
Rikkitikky<br> Rikkitikky<br> reaching in the night,<br>
arms so long and hands so white,<br>
Up from the boards of the floors and stairs<br>
wobbly and rickety where Rikkitikky lairs<br>
<br>
Rikkitikky<br> Rikkitikky,<br> don't take me!<br>
A tough old boney little meal I'd be<br>
Take my sister! <i>She's</i> warm and fat<br>
Bigger than a goose and tender as a bat<br>
<br>
Rikkitikky<br> Rikkitikky,<br> what've you done?<br>
doesn't seem to matter how fast you run<br>
thin white fingers get you by the toe<br>
floorboards creak and down you go...<br>
</div>
