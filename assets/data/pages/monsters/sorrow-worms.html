Of all the crimes our oaths compelled us to, the most unforgivable was neither the murder of the stars nor the betrayal of the corpse-born, but the fate to which we consigned the lords of dreams.<br>
For they had no part in what was done to us, or ours. Their only sin was kindness<br>
We did not deserve the suffering that was inflicted on us, <br>
but by that we have made ourselves worthy of it

	Long ago, it is said, the oubliette was a place of gentle repose: that the candlemakers led those under their care into a realm of peaceful dreams from which there was no awakening. <br><br>
	That time, if ever it was, is long past. The realm of dreams was poisoned long ago, the sorrow worms driven from the shores of the silver lake and it's waters blackened by the putrifying carcass of the murdered god.<br>
	Now, those who fall asleep within the shadow of the oubliette must be wary, for just beyond the edge of mortal sight there lies an abyss of hungry darkness, and beyond that, one of light, which is far more terrible...<br><br>
	Mournworms, Silverworms,  dreamlords: Together with the Seshek, these creatures were the primordial inhabitants of the Oubliette.<br>
	Fleeing the shadow that fell over their home, they made their way into remote places within the old caves. There they carved out enclaves of gentle repose, defended by enchantment and the silver mists of dream, so that those who approach with ill intent are thrown into confusion. Many who do find their way to the springs of the sorrow worms remember only waking from a dream of sad beauty, their wounds healed and limbs rested. <br><br>
	Yet for all their safeguards, the Sorrow Worms are still hunted and their numbers are ever dwindling. Most vigorously by the gremlins, who covet their incandescence with a terrible greed, and who know well their secret weaknesses, but also by humans, who crave the silver laudanum and are not satisfied with what the seshek will peaceably trade. <br><br>
	The treachery of the forsaken came as a great blow to the silverworms, and to the seshek, and has never been forgotten.<br> 
	For it was out of pity for mankind's plight that the worms gave of their tears, and instructed them in the arts by which the malice of the wardens could be averted. In the end, such generosity was their ruin. <br>
	Out of fear of The Blight, the Knights of the Silver Fountain turned that knowledge against them, breaking their oaths and binding their benefactors into cruel captivity. In many places now, the tradition of hunting worms is both glorious and profitable.
