	The Krizzle,<br> the Krizzle,<br> Oh what a sight...<br>
	His body so long and his skin stretched so tight<br>
	That his bones seem to crawl as he looms in the shade<br>
	Oh back in the shadows, where I wish he had stayed!<br>
<br>
	He creeps through the caves, eyeballs burning like hell<br>
	His hideous shrieks are a funeral knell<br>
	For all who should cross him down there in the dark<br>
	As he drops from the roof in a chandelier arc<br>
<br>
	His claws are like razors that slice through your meat<br>
	So it slides off your bones in a wet crimson sheet<br>
	For a creature so large he is horribly quick<br>
	And that sword in your hand may as well be a stick<br>
<br>
	So if you hear noises and bumps in the night<br>
	Don't try to explore or to look for a fight<br>
	Just turn around fast and go back to your base<br>
	For The Krizzle will <b>always</b> remember your face<br>
