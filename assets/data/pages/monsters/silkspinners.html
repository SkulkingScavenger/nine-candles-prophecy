		Silkspinners are domesticated descendants of the Giant Spiders of Zaramon, cultivated mainly in grayhaven and Lantern village.<br> 
		Although slower and less aggressive than their wild cousins, they still require careful handling: They are ill-tempered, especially when hungry, and their venom is still quite dangerous.
		<br><br> 
		They produce silk in greater abundance than giant spiders found in the wild but, perhaps because of their diet, it is considered of much cheaper quality. Ropes made of it are not as strong, cloths are more coarse and of inferior lustre. 
		<br>
		It is still, of course, far better than fibers painstakingly beaten from darkroot or fungus, and the harvesting of giant spider silk is a dangerous job which nobody particularly wants to perform.
