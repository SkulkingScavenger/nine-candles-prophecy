	Bleamworms are vast, colorless creatures that tunnel endlessly through the corrupted stone and soil like wretched, sightless whales, making and unmaking the tunnels as they travel. Mindless they swallow anything in their path indiscriminately, grinding with iron teeth and spewing acidic saliva before them.<br><br>
	In the outer reaches of the Oubliette they grow into terrible armored leviathans, but these are rarely seen except when they surface in the outer darkness of Sherab, where they perform the devastating dances that resound like thunder through the interior.<br><br>
	They feed primarily on the darkroot, but are drawn also to the scent of living warmth.
