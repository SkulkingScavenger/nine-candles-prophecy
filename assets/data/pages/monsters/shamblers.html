		The flesh offers an anchor to the vagrant soul. A name is an anchor to the world.
		<br><br>
		Shamblers are similar to ghouls, in that they can be seen and felt by the living without the aid of enchantment. Some say the distinction between them is pedantic, but it was first made by those who encountered them without knowing their true nature.<br> 
		For the ravenous flesh-hungry ghouls do not particularly resemble these shuffling husks
		<br><br>
		They are often encountered in old ruins in the upper oubliette, sometimes slowly, aimlessly plodding, sometimes holding perfectly still for days, weeks or years at a time. They are not driven to feed... or apparently to anything. Often times one may pass them without provoking any reaction at all. 
		<br>
		And yet, they have been known to wake suddenly to violent life, when attacked but also without any stimulus at all, and at that point they will pursue a target relentlessly across all obstacles. They are practically immune to any weapon not forged of hexsteel: what can one do to a creature whose flesh and organs have already rotted away?
		<br><br>
		Shamblers are found in abundance in the ruins of Korhazar and Raishabar, where they seem to exist naturally, as well as in Hekkath, Tharas and the environs of the Citadel of Candles, where they are largely the results of necromantic endeavor
		<br><br>
		For the arts of stitching flesh and spirit back together after the original bonds have deteriorated were perfected in the catacombs of Hekkath long ago
		<br>
		Since then the secrets of Hekkath necromancy have slowly spread throughout the oubliette. Thus in those places where such practices are permitted, shamblers are employed as bondsmen by local sorcerers and those who can afford to purchase their services. 
		<br><br>
		Such artificial shamblers, bound by enchantment and fearful conjuration to obey the commands of their master, behave quite differently from their wild counterparts.
