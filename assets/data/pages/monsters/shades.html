		In the oubliette, even death is not an escape.<br> In times long past, it was a place of rest and tranquility, a final destination for the souls of the departed. Now it is a black and empty tomb, a prison of the mind and of the heart.<br> And there is no rest here any longer...
		<br><br>
		Those unfortunate souls who cannot be given a proper burial, their bodies left to decay in darkness, are doomed to wander as shades, where the darkness of the oubliette feeds slowly upon what little light remains to them.
		<br><br>
		Shades are the ghosts of the oubliette. Not all are mad, but almost all of the older ones are, and even those who are not have often lost many of their memories.
		<br>
		They cannot generally be seen by those whose minds are caught up in the waking world of reality and whose hearts are full of <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/mechanics/luminosity">luminosity</a>. One might perhaps catch a glimpse or a distant whisper in very dark places, or where the shade is particularly strong.<br>
		They are more easily seen in darkness, and grow stronger and more real when roused by powerful memories, in the presence of places and persons of great significance
		<br><br>
		And of course, all creatures of nightmare are more easily seen by those who themselves have begun to fade. Whether temporarily, at the edge of sleep, or more severely in the grip of the Darkfever. If one lingers long in dark places and neglects due precautions, the shades themselves will pull their victim towards such a state, in the course of their feeding.
		<br>
		For shades crave the luminosity of the living with an overwhelming hunger, and even those too full of light to be directly attacked, they can gnaw upon insidiously like ghostly parasites. 
		<br>
		Woe to those who come upon them in grave darkness of mind!

		The most basic defense against shades, for those of relatively sound mind, is not to linger long in dark places: to carry always a lantern or at least a candle when abroad, to keep the hearth alight, and to remain within sight of the beacons of a village or castle as much as possible.<br> 
		If one is not in a particularly haunted region, it will be alright to put out the lights while asleep: the gnawing of shades is slow and one will easily recover any luminosity lost at night during the day.
		<br>
		If your dreams are troubled, best to sleep by the hearth or with a bedside lantern. It is terribly dangerous to sleep near crypts, graveyards, battlefields or any other place where old ghosts congregate in great numbers, or where a particularly powerful specter is known to dwell.
		<br><br>
		In a village or outpost, good care should be taken of the dead: a well-lit crypt or properly-tended graveyard where candles are kept by the graves, preferably far from the village itself, will help keep the local spirits peaceful. A good mortician can insure the departed do not wander far from their resting places by the working of his art.
		<br><br>
		Candlebearers and Shademarked who are often in dark and haunted places for extended durations will have recourse to a variety of spells, talismans, warding sigils and various enchanted objects to aid in the detection and mitigation of shades, but they tend to keep these to themselves.
		<br><br>
		Finally, if your sanity is slipping and you find yourself surrounded by the silently accusing faces of old friends and enemies, trapped between the boundaries of life and death in a waking nightmare, perhaps the best you can do is to buck up and pay for a weapon of genuine <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/resources/hexsteel">hexsteel</a>. If you don't live in <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/locations/new-tharas">New Tharas</a> and aren't friendly with any <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/rotfang">legendary gremlin smiths</a>, you can buy one from <a href="HYPERLINK_PREFIX/characters/the-peddler">The Peddler</a>.
		<br> 
		Theoretically you could ask a warden to help, and they will be happy to take those pesky lost souls off your hands. But really, you're probably better off with the shades...
