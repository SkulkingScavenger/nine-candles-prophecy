<div class="poem">
	Down in the bogs where the will-o-wisps glow<br>
	In dark rotting marshes where the grothylumps grow<br>
	Lives a cunning old beast, so black and so fell...<br>
	of how wicked her deeds are, I shudder to tell<br>
<br>
	The Shigarga is cruel<br> 
	The Shigarga is wise<br>
	full of hatred like poison, since they took out her eyes<br>
	And don't think you'll be safer because she can't see<br>
	for you never can fool her, and you never can flee<br>
<br>
	She waits in dark waters or in patches of fog<br>
	when she's somewhat submerged, you might think she's a log<br>
	But there's not many logs that'll swallow you whole<br>
	or drown you in waters that're blacker than coal<br>
<br>
	Or stalk you for weeks through mud and black rain<br>
	at the far edge of sight, just to drive you insane<br>
	waiting till you are sure that you've gotten away<br>
	and then gobble you up, just to ruin your day<br>
<br>
	The Shigarga is cruel<br> 
	The Shigarga is wise<br>
	She'll make sure your death is a nasty surprise<br>
	add your bones to the mountains she keeps down below<br>
	in the cold lonely murk, where the grothylumps grow<br>
