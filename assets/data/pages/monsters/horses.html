	Oubliette horses are quick and powerful, with translucent, hairless skin and eyeless skulls. They have human hands and long, black tongues that whisper to the air in a forgotten language. Unlike surface horses, they are agile in the caves, able to wriggle rapidly through tight spaces and climb over ledges.
