Kreekawoors!<br> kreekawoors!<br> Eyes burning white!<br>
He stands very still, always just out of sight<br>
He watches and waits (no one knows just what for)<br>
At the pane of a window,<br> 
In the frame of a door,<br>
and always in darkness, except for his eyes<br>
which glow in the dark like huge pale fire-flies<br>
<br>
Some say they have seen him, and maybe it's true<br>
If he pays <i>you</i> a visit, here's what I would do:<br>
Pretend you saw nothing; just go back to sleep<br>
Don't make any noise or, at most, a small peep<br>
For in speaking of kreekawoors, one thing is certain<br>
If he thinks you don't see him, he'll do you no hurtin'<br>
