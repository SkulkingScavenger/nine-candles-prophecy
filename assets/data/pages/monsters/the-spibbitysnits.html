	The spibbitysnits!<br>
	What does you do with a spibbitysnits?<br>
	skewer him well on some rusty old spits!<br>
	Roast him alive till he loses his wits!<br>
	Then chop him all up into small bloody bits!<br>
	Throw those in a soup-pot and cook him with grits,<br>
	Serve him with with cider and crackers of ritz<br>
	Now <i>That's</i> what you do with a spibbitysnits!
