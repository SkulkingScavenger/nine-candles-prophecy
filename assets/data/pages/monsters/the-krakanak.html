When you're down in the dark, where the stones weep and mutter<br>
and the murkweavers' webs hang like black oily butter<br>
You might hear in the distance a low mournful sound<br>
like the sighs of ghost mom whose children all drowned<br>
If you do, then you know that a lake oh-so-black<br>
which is not very far, holds the last krakanak<br>
<br>
He knows every song, (so my grandmother tells)<br>
from the korhazar caves to the whispering wells<br>
but he only sings one, or at least, ever since<br>
the second-to-last one was slain by a prince<br>
and that song that he sings is the sound you might hear<br>
If in long lonesome journeys you should ever draw near<br>
<br>
"the second-last krakanak"'s the name of the song<br>
And just like his neck, it is terribly long<br>
It begins as a tale of two beasts in a lake<br>
and all the fond mem'ries two monsters can make<br>
but it ends with a sob as he recalls the sight<br>
of a lake colored crimson and a thing floating white<br>
