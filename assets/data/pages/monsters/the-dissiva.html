<div class="poem">
	Son let me tell you a story of warnings and hints<br>
	and a monster who desperately needs some breath-mints<br>
	They call her The Dissivur, The Dissi for short<br>
	An old creature of terrible, dreadful report<br>
<br>
	There is no fouler bird ever lived in these caves<br>
	No excuse can be made for the way she behaves!<br>
	Ah, her teeth merely wound you, her breath is what kills<br>
	even twelve feet away you'll still wish you had gills<br>
<br>
	And the way that she heckles and squawks as you flee!<br>
	It's as deuced and annoying as annoying can be!<br>
	But the worst is what happens if ever you're caught:<br>
	first she'll peck out your eyes and then leave you to rot<br>
<br>
	tied up by your ankles like a rat on a string<br>
	when you can't get away, she'll start trying to sing<br>
	now perhaps you recall what I said of her squawks?<br>
	Well her singing is worse, its like old cucku clocks<br>
<br>
	but a thousand times worse, gee its hard to explain<br>
	to someone who's never been hit by a train<br>
	In fact just forget it, The point has been made<br>
	When you're out in the caves, stay away from her glade!<br>
<br>
