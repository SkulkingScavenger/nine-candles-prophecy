	They are a common sight here, those twisted roots<br> 
	black as pitch, ever seeking... growing in a world where no true tree can live. Their wood is tough, strangely supple, if not fleshy. When cut, they bleed a caustic, flammable sap that burns with a hot, ruddy flame. 
	<br><br>
	Roots they are, after a fashion, but few guess the true nature of those insidious tendrils: the black veins of a crimson heart, carrying its burning words like blood to the nine dominions.<br>
	For they arise from the depths of the oubliette, from the black lake at the foundations of reality, penetrating through time and perception to give dark life to a world that should have died so long ago. 
	<br><br>
	It is by means of the roots that the false sun binds and anchors the living stones, by which it guides the tunnels and ensnares the souls of mankind, ever seeking to remake the waking world in accordance with the burning designs of the crimson architect.
